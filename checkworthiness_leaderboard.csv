131,Let me help the governor.
219,"The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don't you?"
384,This isn't a question of a little charity for the homeless.
411,Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort.
432,I don't think it's a good thing.
591,But I'll tell you what I was thinking of.
611,I'm simply not going to do that.
726,He's got to get this thing more clear.
750,"Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions."
816,And I think it's important to understand what happened here.
826,You cannot make concessions to terrorists.
893,I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.
942,I don't want to go back to malaise and misery index.
1036,We can also have a- an end to the extremes.
1116,I don't believe it will happen.
1128,"But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh - decision might be or what option he might exercise."
1150,And I know that everybody uh - makes mistakes.
1204,"Well, first, uh - let me set the record straight."
1233,I would do the opposite in every respect.
1242,"A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh - eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing - in things like housing, uh - pollution control, uh - crime control, education, welfare and health."
1255,The last point is that the major - uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work.
1260,"And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that's now paid by the state governments."
1263,Let me uh - speak out very strongly.
1311,I would not work hard to support any of those.
1406,"Well, I think the answer uh - as to the kind of person that I would select uh - is obvious."
1554,I love America just as all of you love America.
1582,We don't have good health care.
1596,Now I don't know all the answers.
1600,We might have to do it slowly.
1604,"I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington."
1669,I've got a different view.
1674,And I'm looking forward to having that debate.
1698,"Crack down on China, if and when they cheat."
1943,What things would I cut from spending?
2156,"But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring."
2688,And Republicans and Democrats both love America.
2842,"I believe that the United States ha- had many successes in recent years, in recent months, as far as the Communist movement is concerned."
2855,We wanted to have majority rule with the full protection of the rights of the minority.
2902,"Every time Mr. Ford speaks from a position of secrecy in negotiations, in secret - in secret treaties that've been uh - pursued and achieved, in supporting dictatorships, in ignoring human rights, we are weak and the rest of the world knows it."
3073,"I would uh - also like to point out that we, in this country, have let our economy go down the drain."
3090,"Now, I can't say when this can come."
3139,"I believe that the cruise missiles which we are now developing in research and development across the spectrum from air, from the sea, or from the land, uh - can be uh - included within a SALT II agreement."
3262,Now I would be willing to go ahead with negotiations.
3321,It may later be Catholics; it may be - later be Baptists who are threatened by some foreign country.
3322,But we ought to stand staunch.
3339,But not until they have given us the full accounting of our MIAs.
3369,"I remember the world with NATO, and the world of Point Four, and the world of the Marshall Plan, and the world of the Peace Corps."
3385,America is at peace and with freedom.
3429,How's it going to affect my job?
3436,"Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes."
3440,And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.
3441,"That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight."
3519,Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?
3539,"And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us."
3555,"I've got a pen, and I'm going to veto every single spending bill that comes across my desk."
3579,Maybe to Senator Obama it's not a lot of money.
3583,Do you know that it's gone completely out of control to the point where it corrupts people?
3595,The worst thing we could do in this economic climate is to raise people's taxes.
3647,"I know we have to, but this is a classic example of walking the walk and talking the talk."
3694,We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.
3695,And one of the things I think we have to do is make sure that college is affordable for every young person in America.
3698,So there are some -- some things that we've got to do structurally to make sure that we can compete in this global economy.
3975,But we have to get the cooperation of the people in those areas.
4202,But we have to have a president who is clear that you don't deal with Russia based on staring into his eyes and seeing his soul.
4250,The second point I want to make is -- is the issue of energy.
4275,"So I want to say that, with the Nunn-Lugar thing..."
4336,"The other thing that we have to focus on, though, is Al Qaida."
4387,That sense is something that I want to restore.
4393,And I know that they know that I'll take care of them.
4398,And that's going to be my job.
4401,I don't think I need any on-the-job training.
5487,"Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you."
5491,"Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry."
5493,"They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry."
5496,"But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes."
5502,"Now, I know the criticism of this."
5503,"Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?"
5506,And so we've got to reverse this.
5527,And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.
5528,"Last point I want to make, though."
5540,"Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees."
5541,And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income.
5559,"And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now."
5565,"In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around."
5570,Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?
5571,"Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around."
5582,"I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes, including myself."
5583,"But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it."
5587,"Well, I don't mind paying a little more."
5592,We need to cut the business tax rate in America.
5594,"Now, of all times in America, we need to cut people's taxes."
5595,"We need to encourage business, create jobs, not spread the wealth around."
5609,But there is no doubt that we've been living beyond our means and we're going to have to make some adjustments.
5614,So let me get to that.
5622,"And I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page, programs that don't work, we should cut."
5630,"And we're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility, all of us, corporations, the federal government, and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means."
5641,But -- OK. All right.
5643,"Energy -- well, first -- second of all, energy independence."
5644,We have to have nuclear power.
5648,"OK, what -- what would I cut?"
5655,I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending.
5676,And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work.
5692,And let me tell you...
5713,"So the fact is, let's look at our records, Senator Obama."
5736,We need to move in a new direction.
5738,"Let me just say, Bob."
5764,So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.
5773,"So I want to tell you, we will run a truthful campaign."
5774,This is a tough campaign.
5779,And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.
5783,"Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough."
5788,"And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply."
5815,You've got to read what he said...
5823,"The important point here is, though, the American people have become so cynical about our politics, because all they see is a tit- for-tat and back-and-forth."
5827,We do and I hope...
5830,"But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists, then we're not talking about issues."
5849,"I mean, we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other's campaigns."
5860,"Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist."
5864,"So all of these things need to be examined, of course."
5886,Let me tell you who I associate with.
5894,And the facts are facts and records are records.
5907,"Well, Joe Biden, I think, is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country."
5936,"Her husband's a pretty tough guy, by the way, too."
5941,"I agree with that, John."
5942,"I do want to just point out that autism, for example, or other special needs will require some additional funding, if we're going to get serious in terms of research."
5947,I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects.
5948,"But I do point out that he's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues, which is supposed to be his strength."
5974,"Senator Obama will tell you, in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do, it has to be safe."
5996,"But I also believe that for far too long, certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Senator McCain, the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement."
6004,We've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that.
6006,"Well, you know, I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence."
6016,"Now, on the subject of free trade agreements."
6019,But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Senator Obama opposes.
6049,"Look, as I travel around the country, this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again."
6057,The only thing we're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you.
6064,We've got to put more money into preventive care.
6072,And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things.
6073,We need to put health care records online.
6080,We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools.
6087,"Now, Senator Obama, I'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be, and I don't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America's economy."
6107,So here's what we do.
6132,"I'm going to give them $5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go, and this will give them affordability."
6133,This will give them availability.
6135,This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies.
6138,"I want, Joe, you to do the job."
6139,I want to leave money in your pocket.
6141,That's what I'm all about.
6152,And don't take my word for it.
6154,"All I want to do, if you've already got health care, is lower your costs."
6164,That's not appropriate to do.
6168,I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states.
6178,This is a very important issue we're talking about.
6183,And so that's what I will do.
6187,I would consider anyone in their qualifications.
6192,"And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president."
6194,Now I would not provide a litmus test.
6196,I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.
6213,We have to change the culture of America.
6214,Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that.
6215,And it's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who's facing this terribly difficult decision.
6227,"Yes, let me respond to this."
6243,We should try to reduce these circumstances.
6247,"Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama."
6273,"If we do those things, then I believe that we can create a better school system."
6276,Parents are going to have to show more responsibility.
6287,"Now, throwing money at the problem is not the answer."
6289,So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers.
6291,"Look, we must improve education in this country."
6292,"As far as college education is concerned, we need to make those student loans available."
6307,I think it's important to foster competition inside the public schools.
6328,And we need to fix a lot of the problems.
6331,I think the Head Start program is a great program.
6338,We need to have transparency.
6344,And we'll care for these young children.
6351,I'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C.
6392,And that's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.
6399,In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future.
6402,And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House.
6403,But it's not going to be easy.
6406,I'm absolutely convinced we can do it.
7396,"And frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet."
7340,"If a president doesn't reach out and bring people in and be inclusive, then how are we going to get over those barriers?"
7336,"Now, let me just share something."
7269,"But I think it makes sense, I think most Americans in their guts know, that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard."
7180,Is that a new question or a 30-second question?
7162,You cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem.
7143,We also need to hold on to equal pay.
7142,What we need to do is raise the minimum wage.
7131,"Well, I'm glad you raised that question."
7082,I don't think we ought to reward illegal behavior.
7074,"And so in order to take pressure off the borders, in order to make the borders more secure, I believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up, so long as there's not an American willing to do that job, to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers' needs."
7049,But the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on small-business owners.
7023,I have a plan to put America back to work.
6993,We're going to protect Social Security.
6992,And that's what we're going to do.
6946,Americans ought to have it too.
6910,"If it's good enough for us, it's good enough for every American."
6903,But I got a better plan.
6776,"It's between a woman, God and her doctor."
6729,"You know, Bob, I don't know."
6701,"I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives."
6584,I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker.
6449,"Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight."
7596,There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.
7637,"But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev."
7650,I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.
7653,"Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools."
7702,We are a goldfish bowl before the world.
7722,Let me s- look also at what I did.
7747,Now looking to what we ought to do in the future.
7847,"Third, I believe we should step up the use of our surplus foods in these areas until we're able to get the people back to work."
7871,"I think in many ways this election is more important than any since 1932, or certainly almost any in this century."
7923,"On the question of the summit, I agree with the position of Mr. Nixon."
7939,"Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States."
8016,"I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line."
8123,"This is a great country, but I think it could be a greater country; and this is a powerful country, but I think it could be a more powerful country."
8136,I'm not satisfied until every American enjoys his full constitutional rights.
8164,That is the obligation upon our generation.
8188,Is the United States standing still?
8222,What kind of programs are we for?
8229,I think that the means that I advocate will reach that goal better than the means that he advocates.
8239,Because it isn't a question of how much the federal government spends; it isn't a question of which government does the most.
8310,In my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance.
8319,I of course disagree with Senator Kennedy insofar as his suggestions as to what should be done uh - with re- on the farm program.
8353,Uh - I can only say that my experience is there for the people to consider; Senator Kennedy's is there for the people to consider.
8422,Why did Senator Kennedy take that position then?
8437,My objection here is not the cost in dollars.
8533,That's why we have to continue to be alert.
8546,Now that isn't the test of whether America moves.
8562,"I think that's the big assignment, the big task, the big function of the federal government."
8596,And I stand for programs that will mean growth and progress.
8597,But it is also essential that he not allow a dollar spent that could be better spent by the people themselves.
8612,The means are at issue.
8710,Why not leave it with them?
8718,"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself."
8824,"That is just a downpayment, in my opinion."
8835,But I am not in favor of the plan that is so costly.
8974,"Now also, with regard to the figures about California."
9000,"Now, whether it is rightful, on a single issue, for anyone to advocate that someone should not be elected or not, I won't take a position on that."
9027,"With regard to the freedom of the individual for choice with regard to abortion, there's one individual who's not being considered at all."
9063,"I believe the people of this country can, and together, we can begin the world over again."
9128,"Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this -- this debate."
9136,We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.
9145,I know what it takes to get this economy going.
9150,I'm going to change that.
9164,"Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright."
9247,We've also got to look to the future.
9272,So where'd the increase come from?
9292,I'll get America and North America energy independent.
9294,We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.
9332,How much did you cut them by?
9333,I'm happy to answer the question.
9350,And production on gas --
9367,I don't think the American people believe that.
9395,And we need to win that future.
9396,And I intend to win it as President of the United States.
9457,Why am I lowering taxes on the middle-class?
9461,"And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class."
9487,It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.
9494,I think that grows the economy.
9495,I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.
9516,We don't have to live like this.
9591,"Well, Katherine, that's a great question."
9630,Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.
9677,And I appreciate that question.
9683,The time -- the time...
9693,Let me come back and -- and answer your question.
9694,President Bush and I are -- are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.
9716,I know how to make that happen.
9735,But the last point I want to make is this.
9860,Thank you for your question.
9867,I want it to be streamlined.
9868,I want it to be clearer.
9872,We should make sure our legal system works.
9876,So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.
9952,"Mr. President, let me finish."
9984,I do want to make sure that -- I do want to make sure that we just understand something.
9992,And we want to encourage that.
10040,"Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one."
10088,"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?"
10102,I'm happy to have a longer conversation --
10196,But -- but it'll -- it'll -- it'll be...
10261,OK. We need to create jobs here.
10275,"The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports."
10292,We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.
10298,"We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one."
10333,"Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it."
10337,I want 100 percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.
10338,I care about our kids.
10359,I will get us on track to a balanced budget.
10372,I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.
10386,And I want to fight for them.
10437,"Well, Alan (ph), thank you very much for the question."
10451,The middle-class need a rescue package.
10455,"And then long-term we've got to fix our health care system, we've got to fix our energy system that is putting such an enormous burden on families."
10461,"And, Alan (ph), thank you for your question."
10462,You go to the heart of America's worries tonight.
10464,It's our job to fix the problem.
10465,"Now, I have a plan to fix this problem and it has got to do with energy independence."
10467,We have to keep Americans' taxes low.
10469,Let's not raise taxes on anybody today.
10472,We've got to have a package of reforms and it has got to lead to reform prosperity and peace in the world.
10479,And we've got to give some trust and confidence back to America.
10494,"But I think the first criteria, Tom, would have to be somebody who immediately Americans identify with, immediately say, we can trust that individual."
10498,She knows how to create jobs.
10508,Prosperity is not just going to trickle down.
10513,"And that's why, for example, on tax policy, what I want to do is provide a middle class tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans, those who are working two jobs, people who are not spending enough time with their kids, because they are struggling to make ends meet."
10514,Senator McCain is right that we've got to stabilize housing prices.
10574,I think it depends on what we do.
10579,Americans' workers are the best in the world.
10586,And we've got to give them a chance.
10587,They've got -- we've got to give them a chance to do their best again.
10597,Maybe you don't go out to dinner as much.
10610,So here's what I would do.
10615,We are mortgaging our children's future.
10630,And we need to reform.
10634,I don't expect you to watch every vote.
10659,I think it's very important that we reform our entitlement programs.
10682,So we've got to deal with that right away.
10685,And we can do it.
10687,So that would be priority number one.
10692,We do need to look at our records.
10699,That's what I'm going to do as president of the United States.
10707,"Well, Fiora (ph), I'm going to ask the American people to understand that there are some programs that we may have to eliminate."
10713,I believe that we have to eliminate the earmarks.
10719,"And, by the way, I want to go back a second."
10720,"Look, we can attack health care and energy at the same time."
10723,"We can, with the participation of all Americans, work together and solve these problems together."
10730,That wasn't the kind of call to service that I think the American people were looking for.
10737,We're going to have to develop clean coal technology and safe ways to store nuclear energy.
10738,"But each and every one of us can start thinking about how can we save energy in our homes, in our buildings."
10762,"Well, you know, nailing down Senator Obama's various tax proposals is like nailing Jell-O to the wall."
10771,"I've got some news, Senator Obama, the news is bad."
10794,"So let's be clear about my tax plan and Senator McCain's, because we're not going to be able to deal with entitlements unless we understand the revenues coming in."
10815,I want to get to Medicare in a second.
10842,And our best days are ahead of us.
10859,"Now, how -- what's -- what's the best way of fixing it?"
10874,"And we can do it, but we're going to have to make an investment."
10889,We've got to make sure that we're giving them the energy that they need or helping them to create the energy that they need.
10892,I'm just trying to keep up with John.
10899,I think pure research and development investment on the part of the United States government is certainly appropriate.
10901,"By the way, my friends, I know you grow a little weary with this back-and-forth."
10952,"Well, thank you for the question."
10955,And we need to do all of the things that are necessary to make it more efficient.
10959,Let's do a lot of things to impose efficiencies.
10967,"I want to give every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit."
10970,Don't we go across state lines when we purchase other things in America?
10974,But the point is that we have got to give people choice in America and not mandate things on them and give them the ability.
10978,We've got to give them the wherewithal to do it.
10998,So let me -- let me just talk about this fundamental difference.
11001,All I'm going to do is help you to lower the premiums on it.
11026,And that is one of the challenges that America faces.
11061,"Well, we may not always have national security issues at stake, but we have moral issues at stake."
11062,"If we could have intervened effectively in the Holocaust, who among us would say that we had a moral obligation not to go in?"
11065,"And so I do believe that we have to consider it as part of our interests, our national interests, in intervening where possible."
11072,And that's what I intend to do when I'm president.
11074,"Well, let me just follow up, my friends."
11080,"And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again."
11081,But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation.
11094,And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda.
11130,And that is to get the support of the people.
11132,"And by working and coordinating our efforts together, not threatening to attack them, but working with them, and where necessary use force, but talk softly, but carry a big stick."
11145,It'd be fine with me.
11191,"We are going to have to make the Iraqi government start taking more responsibility, withdraw our troops in a responsible way over time, because we're going to have to put some additional troops in Afghanistan."
11195,And we want a democracy in Afghanistan.
11203,We have to have a streamlined NATO command structure.
11204,We have to do a lot of things.
11210,We will succeed and we will bring our troops home with honor and victory and not in defeat.
11228,"But the Russians must understand that these kinds of actions and activities are not acceptable and hopefully we will use the leverage, economic, diplomatic and others united with our allies, with our allies and friends in Europe who are equally disturbed as we are about their recent behaviors."
11234,And for the most part I agree with Senator McCain on many of the steps that have to be taken.
11235,But we can't just provide moral support.
11240,"The other thing we have to do, though, is we've got to see around the corners."
11277,"Well, thank you, Terry (ph)."
11278,And thank you for your service to the country.
11293,And I think we can do that.
11295,"But, at the end of the day, my friend, I have to tell you again, and you know what it's like to serve, and you know what it's like to sacrifice, but we can never allow a second Holocaust to take place."
11299,It would be a game-changer in the region.
11302,And I will do everything that's required to prevent it.
11327,But here's what I do know.
11333,And the question in this election is: are we going to pass on that same American dream to the next generation?
11340,That's what's at stake in this election.
11351,"There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different -- we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans."
11357,I know what it's like to have to fight to keep one's hope going through difficult times.
11665,I thought that was a good model.
11676,I don't think we agree on that.
11975,And I think that's a private matter.
12557,"And so we need military strength, we need economic strength, we also need the right diplomatic policies."
12568,"And you cannot fight a victory for Communism or a strategy of victory for Communism with the strategy, simply of holding the line."
12613,But are we doing enough in these areas?
12619,Are we doing enough in that area?
12651,I think we are today.
12690,"Now, what can we do?"
12736,So that is my answer to this question.
12750,"Second, as far as this report is concerned, I would have no objection to having it made public."
12791,"I think we should go back to Geneva, who's ever elected president, Mr. Nixon or myself, and try once again."
12829,This means at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level.
12832,"I don't believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda, unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from Mr. Khrushchev that he intends seriously to negotiate on those points."
12885,We can make it move.
12922,"If he says that, this issue will not be discussed in the campaign."
12990,Let's talk about civil rights.
12994,Anybody that says America has been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling in America.
13002,"It is essential that we extend freedom, extend it to all the world."
13003,And this means more than what we've been doing.
13144,"Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris."
13153,"Now, we may not succeed."
13187,What do we do then?
13198,But certainly we're not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom.
13206,"I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island."
13295,"I don't suggest that, I don't support it."
13322,"Uh - Also, so that we can get the uh - opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate."
13346,The difficulty now is the president's course is quite limited.
13388,"I don't believe we ought to pay our bills through inflation, through a phony interest rate."
13396,"We've got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war - uh - for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America."
13403,We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas.
13462,And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing.
13469,I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less.
13502,I believe that we must be able to compete in the market - steel and in all the basic commodities abroad - we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead.
13790,I thought you'd forgotten I was here.
14104,So I have to stand up for myself.
14659,I don't think we're a declining nation.
14752,"Then the question is, can we govern?"
14937,I'll have to get this out very fast.
15125,"I have no quarrel whatsoever with the things that have been done, because I believe it is high time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that there is no room worldwide for terrorism; there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind."
15167,"To negotiate with the Soviet Union a balanced, controlled, observable, and then reducing levels of atomic weaponry, there is a disturbing pattern in the attitude of Governor Reagan."
15259,I just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a better job of producing the things that people need than government can.
15409,I thought that was the subject we were supposed to be on.
15418,"I've seen the strength of my nation, and I've seen the crises it approached in a tentative way."
15422,I consider myself in the mainstream of my party.
15426,"And we must extend the benefits of our own commitment to peace, to create a peaceful world."
15460,I know that the economic program that I have proposed for this nation in the next few years can resolve many of the problems that trouble us today.
15491,And I want to call a hemispheric summit just as soon after the 20th of January as possible to fight that war.
15525,"You know, the American people are fair."
15527,They want to judge it on the record itself.
15559,"And I don't want to do that, and I won't do that."
15561,And it's going to take discipline of the executive branch; it's going to take discipline of the congressional branch.
15564,The American people are pretty smart: they know who writes out the checks.
15565,And they know who appropriates the money.
15570,"And those pessimists who say it can't be done, I'm sorry, I just have a fundamental disagreement with them"
15583,will go out and do the job that we expect of him and do it with the Congress of the United States.
15597,"We can do all of those things, and at the same time build a future in which we are standing on a good strong fiscal foundation."
15607,I'm not going to do that; I won't do that.
15632,"I think the presidency of the United States is a very serious office, and I think we have to address these issues in a very serious way."
15633,So I hope and expect that I will be liked by the people of this country as president of the United States; I certainly hope I will be liked by them on the 8th of November.
15638,"So that pledge isn't realistic, and I think the vice president knows it; I think the people of this country know it."
15640,"And I am going to be a president who is serious, I hope and expect will be liked by the American people."
15641,"But more than that, to do the kind of job that I'm elected to do, will do it with as much good humor as I can, but at the same time will do it in a way which will achieve the goals we want for ourselves and our people."
15645,"I think it's whether you share the broad dreams of the American people, whether you have confidence in the people's ability to get things done or whether you think it all should be turned over, as many of the liberals do, to Washington, D.C. You see, I think it's a question of values, not likability or loveability, it's a question in foreign affairs in experience, knowing world leaders, knowing how to build on a superb record of this administration in arms control, because you'd know exactly how to begin."
15646,You have to learn from experience that making unilateral cuts in defense system is not the way that you enhance peace.
15648,"It is, though, trying to understand the heartbeat of the country."
15682,It's our vision of America.
15686,"I think this is a great country, because we've always wanted to do better, to make our country better, to make our lives better."
15689,That's the kind of leadership I want to provide.
15690,"But I don't think these labels mean a thing and I would hope that tonight in the course of the rest of this campaign, we can have good solid disagreements on issues."
15718,"They continue to modernize and we can't simply we've got enough nuclear weapons, let's freeze."
15726,"Now, my defense secretary is going to have a lot to do with those decisions, but it's going to be the President who's going to have to ultimately decide before that budget goes to the Congress what weapons systems are going to go and what are going to stay."
15730,Those are decisions that the chief executive has to make.
15731,"Yes, we're going to have a strong and credible and effective nuclear deterrent."
15750,So military security and economic security go hand in hand.
15751,And we will have a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.
15763,Can we start the clock over?
15787,Some of my fellow governors who are real heroes to me.
15789,We were proud of them.
15796,"But more than that, they are role models."
15801,These are people that give of themselves everyday and every week and every month.
15810,"And there's nothing corny about having sports heroes, young people that are clean and honorable and out there setting the pace."
15829,I had something very nice to say in there.
15842,And so I would say that the concept of the Dukakis family has my great respect.
15856,I salute those who participate in the political process.
15874,We may have different approaches.
15881,the tone we've just heard might just be the tone we have for the rest of the campaign.
15905,"But that's the way I, George Bush, feel about it."
15930,It's not going to happen overnight; it certainly will have to happen on a step-by-step basis as we make progress in arms negotiation and arms control and arms reduction.
15937,"See, I don't believe any other country can pick up the mantel."
15939,I don't think we can turn over these kinds of decisions of the collective defense to the United Nations or anything else.
15947,We don't give away our hand before we sit down at the head table.
15987,The Congress is doing a better job of it.
15989,But they don't work if you go raise taxes and then the Congress spends it continues to spend that.
16006,And there are several there's a good political reason because it's just about this time of year that the Democrats start saying the Republicans are going to take away your Social Security.
16017,We do not have to do it.
16044,I won't support judges like that.
16046,But I will go out there and find men and women to interpret.
16047,"And I don't have a list, but I think the appointments that the President has made to the Bench have been outstanding, outstanding appointments."
16093,"But I do think there are flexible ways to solve some of the pressing problems, particularly that affect our children."
16099,We're going to tell you how to do it all.
16101,You ought to go out and see around this country what's happening in the volunteer section: Americans helping America.
16116,I just have to correct the record.
16131,It's a contract between generations.
16184,"So I'll just keep saying, I am one."
16186,I'm not going to do that.
16187,That boo was excessively loud.
16193,I believe in our parks.
16227,I will not agree to another debate.
16236,But I'll try harder to keep it on a high plane.
16246,But it's not getting out because there are too few debates.
16256,"(Laughter, applause) Isn't that the point?"
16257,Most Americans believe in basic values.
16258,We have differences about how to achieve them.
16263,"But those are the issues on which we ought to be debating and if we can just put away the flag factories and the balloons and those kinds of thing and get on to a real discussion of these issues, I think we will have a good success."
16269,But we also need well-equipped and well-trained and well-supported conventional forces.
16274,"Let's get him working on Syria, their client state, and see if we can't get them to join Israel and other Arab nations, if at all possible, and Arab leaders, in finally bringing peace to that troubled region."
16275,And I think that's one reason why we need fresh leadership in the White House that can make progress now in bringing peace to the Middle East.
16276,"Let's go to work and end this fiasco in Central America, a failed policy which has actually increased Cuban and Soviet influence."
16281,"And we've got to work with them if we are going to create an environment for human rights and democracy for the people of this hemisphere, and go to work on our single most important problem, and that is the avalanche of drugs that is poring into our country and virtually destroying those countries."
16307,Maybe the Vice President has an answer.
16308,But I'm somebody who believes very strongly in taking care of the fundamentals first before you start new stuff.
16313,"Maybe in Idaho, to take care of the requirements, nuclear material requirements, for our Defense Department?"
16315,"This sounds like real progress here, because we've had a big difference on the safe use of nuclear power for our energy base."
16316,"I believe that we must use clean, safe nuclear power."
16320,So I am one who believes that we can
16332,I believe that public service is honorable.
16340,I will see that these standards apply to the United States Congress.
16388,Sometimes it does seem that a campaign generates more heat than light.
16392,I want to invest in our children.
16402,"America stands tall again, and as a result, we are credible."
16408,And I ask for your support on November 8th.
16410,"Working together, we can do wonderful things for the United States and the Free World."
16467,"Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time."
16509,And this is why a tax reform is so important.
16579,"But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the - uh pardon or the amnesty of uh - those who evaded the draft, but - but whether or not our crime system is - is fair."
16600,We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members.
16626,We uh - have got to do that at the federal government level.
16674,We'll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary.
16847,"So where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief - would you, in fact, do away with all business deductions, and what other kinds of preferences would you do away with?"
16851,"I would never do anything that would increase the taxes for those who work for a living, or who are presently required to list all their income."
16882,But I think the feeling is misplaced.
16896,That's where the problem is and I hope there'll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States.
16909,"If we have a Democratic Congress next year, and a president who wants to spend an additional one hundred billion dollars a year, or maybe two hundred billion dollars a year, with more programs, we will have in my judgment, greater deficits with more spending, more dangers of inflation."
16927,I might go back to one other thing.
16988,But I think it's time to talk about the future.
16991,"It's a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government."
16996,I believe in our country.
17000,"In addition to that, we've suffered because we haven't had leadership in this administration."
17012,"I owe everything to you, the people of this country."
17034,We must make this next century the century of the individual.
17111,"And so, I think that the lines can meet."
17134,"I think this is a test of leadership, and I think the American people know the difference."
17159,Everybody remembers that; people know what happened.
17264,We all know the possibility of terrorism.
17283,"I think our faith tells us, instructs us, about the moral life that we should lead."
17331,"It seems to me that a moment's reflection tells you why the United States Senate turned that amendment down, because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicizing it."
17361,The American people want to keep opening doors.
17476,This is one of the most emotional and difficult issues that could possibly be debated.
17485,But there are some things that government can do and some things they cannot do.
17506,You've got another life involved.
17523,"But in this great society of ours, wouldn't it make a lot more sense, in this gentle and kind society, if we had a program that made it possible for when incidents come along in which someone feels they must do away with that unborn child, that instead we make it available for the adoption?"
17578,I'm not going to increase taxes.
17610,You remember the last time you said that?
17619,You can't wish it away.
17667,That had nothing to do with the other thing of talking about their needs or anything.
17681,Certainly education and training is crucial.
17686,I think the President genuinely believes that they're better off.
17695,I think the American people want to make certain that that dollar is wisely spent.
17721,There's no way of glossing around that.
17749,But now we need both that kind of discipline and the resources and the consistent leadership that allows this country to catch up in education and science and training.
17766,Will you finally touch that defense budget?
17773,"I'll tell you what I think has been the most outrageous thing in political dialog, both in this campaign and the one in '82."
17850,Is America better off than it was 4 years ago?
17883,I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate.
17898,Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt?
18007,People out there listening know what I believe.
18074,It's the hardest decision a president makes.
18120,They just need the help to be trained.
18139,This president just -- I don't know if he sees what's really happened over there.
18225,"But, again, I want to tell the American people, we're doing everything we can at home, but you better have a president who chases these terrorists down and bring them to justice before they hurt us again."
18380,I understand how hard it is.
18410,It's what leadership is based on.
18412,"I have nothing but respect for the British, Tony Blair, and for what they've been willing to do."
18509,"So you say, ""Was it worth it?"""
18589,"He's a brave, brave man."
18627,But a president must always be willing to use troops.
18768,"The minute we have bilateral talks, the six-party talks will unwind."
18859,And I have great respect and admiration for his wife.
18860,I think she's a terrific person...
19006,The issue is what you do about it.
19059,I appreciate your listening tonight.
19061,And may God continue to bless our great land.
19262,But Senator Dole's plans are not good for the country.
19417,And I hope we can do better.
21237,I want to rebuild our military to keep the peace.
21636,They ought to be engaged in making high speed rail.
21954,"Therefore, you don't know what's it like."
22462,I'd go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.
23567,"Plus, I want them all voting for me."
23743,"Thanks for your questions tonight, very, very much."
23761,I believe America's best days are ahead of us.
23824,"Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature."
23850,"I believe experience counts, but it's not everything."
23855,And we have to change in this country.
23865,We need a new approach.
23866,The same old experience is not relevant.
23895,"If there's more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I'm the wrong man."
23905,"And I'm sorry, but demonstrating -- it's not a question of patriotism."
23906,It's a question of character and judgment.
23972,We've got to have no more trickle down.
23993,"And then when you add in his other spending proposals, regrettably you end up socking it to the working man."
24010,And that's about all I can say in a minute.
24016,"If you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in Europe, it would be exorbitant."
24031,"I've seen what it is like to see a war, to see the burdens of a war, and I don't want to see us make reckless cuts."
24047,"So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base."
24050,I agree with the general statement Mr. Bush made.
24077,Why do we have to do it?
24087,"(Laughter and applause) But--but--see, let me make it very clear."
24089,"If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do."
24105,"You see, I have a fundamental difference."
24117,But I do not want to go the tax-and-spend route.
24138,"So her best help for short term is job retraining, if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant."
24166,No other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that.
24199,"Well, obviously, my orientation is let's go do it."
24209,But first we must have an aggressive jobs program.
24231,"Well, let me say that I think that we might ought to review the terms, the way it works."
24246,I don't think the Fed ought to be put under the Executive Branch.
24255,"In terms of vetoing tax bills, you're darn right."
24256,I am going to protect the American taxpayer against the spend and tax Congress.
24306,"So, in terms of priorities, we've got to be financially strong."
24364,"If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the democratic interests of the people of China."
24405,"I am not going to commit US forces until I know what the mission is, till the military tell me that it can be completed, and till I know how they can come out."
24419,"But I must stop short of using American force until I know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in, know what the mission is, and define it."
24426,We cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up.
24432,It's a different world now.
24464,"I believe that discipline and respect for the law -- all of these things should be taught to children, not in our schools, but families have to do that."
24466,But it's gotten too much.
24478,"And I think, my gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if every child had that love and support."
24496,But we've got to keep fighting on this war against drugs.
24512,"Anytime you think you want to legalize drugs, go to a neonatal unit -- if you can get in."

37204,"It's because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can, not from the luxury of -- of a debate or a television panel or a committee room but on the ground, issues from poverty to justice in policing."
37207,But I will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work.
37271,And what I'm going to say is this.
37344,"But I am asking for your support because I know that if I'm -- if I'm going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything, without any compromise, I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world."
37358,So much is broken in this country.
37385,"We lead the world when we lead by example, not by our power."
37429,We have plenty of time.
37444,"So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris."
37455,"Now, what's at stake here is the President's made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act."
37464,"And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there's a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well."
37467,"If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward."
37472,We're not elected for three years.
37491,We do not wipe any.
37516,"You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected."
37526,The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade.
37564,"Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare."
37568,The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.
37583,"You could have done it during your 47-year period in government, but you didn't do it."
37591,"I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth."
37620,"I'm here standing facing you, old buddy."
37626,I'm going to get very lucky tonight as well.
37684,"Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work."
37719,He doesn't want to answer the question.
37758,He knew it was a deadly disease.
37793,You don't know how many people died in India.
37799,You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible.
37805,The Governors said I did a phenomenal job.
37831,Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.
37832,"14,000 people died, not 200,000."
37839,How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID?
37865,They can go faster than that by a lot.
37880,"We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day."
37897,You'll have the vaccine sooner than that.
37909,You can trust the scientist.
37921,Do you believe for a moment what he's telling you in light of all the lies he's told you about the whole issue relating to COVID?
37937,"There's nothing smart about you, Joe."
37970,"Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second."
38006,He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.
38042,Nobody shows up to his rallies.
38109,"One of them came out last week, you saw that, ""Oh, we're going to open up on November 9th."""
38145,Fewer jobs than when he became president.
38159,They've done nothing to help small businesses.
38172,They don't want to be shut down.
38177,"It's almost like a ghost town, and I'm not sure it can ever recover what they've done to New York."
38180,People want to be safe.
38182,People want to be safe.
38195,"And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-"
38226,"Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama Administration, if you can believe that."
38260,"And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American."
38262,"And under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-"
38287,All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot.
38293,Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave.
38316,"They said it would take... No, you're on number two."
38321,... a miracle to bring back manufacturing.
38328,I'm the guy that brought back the automobile industry.
38329,He totally gave up on manufacturing.
38332,We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan.
38337,Ohio had the best year it's ever had last year.
38552,"If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle."
38598,It was sort of a reversal.
38614,I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk].
38620,Many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings.
38639,Look what happened in Baltimore.
38654,Are you in favor of law and order?
38719,"Oh, really, who do you have?"
38728,Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.
38753,I sent in the US Marshals...
38803,"Sure, I'm willing to do that."
38806,I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing not from the right wing.
38826,Antifa is an idea not an organization...
38827,Oh you gotta be kidding.
38840,"You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group."
38851,"But despite going through all of these things where I had to fight, both flanks and behind me and above, there has never been an administration that's done what I've done."
38866,"By the end of the first term, I'll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300, and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices."
38869,"When you leave office, you don't leave any judges."
38921,"I'm talking about my son, Beau Biden, you're talking about Hunter?"
38924,Hunter got thrown out of the military.
38942,I'm proud of my son.
38976,"If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally."
38991,But I also think we have to do better management of our forests.
39000,"He said, ""Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California."
39009,Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.
39011,"Well, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive, and it's a much safer car, and you're talking about a tiny difference."
39012,And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased.
39020,The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline.
39042,Creating millions of good-paying jobs.
39055,"Well, he hadn't drawn a line."
39075,"That is not, that is not..."
39116,"We in fact, but the rest of the world, we've got to get them to come along."
39204,Vote whatever way is the best way for you.
39212,He can't stay in power.
39217,"Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?"
39225,"They were a disgrace to our country, and we've caught 'em."
39249,"The other thing, it's nice."
39255,Take a look at what happened in Manhattan.
39284,"I don't think-I hope we don't need them, in terms of the election itself."
39286,"I just heard, I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated."
39317,This is not going to end well.
39326,"If it doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted."
39430,"The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too."
39437,I'll be a president for Democrats and Republicans.
39482,And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard.
39509,"And there are over 70,000 new cases per day."
39513,"If we just wore these masks - the President's own advisors have told him - we could save 100,000 lives."
39530,Moderna is doing very well.
39569,We owe him a debt of gratitude.
39571,"And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people."
39583,"I don't know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement."
39591,"And you know, I caught it."
39636,"Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this."
39638,And that went on for months.
39641,"But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing."
39643,"I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China."
39666,Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums.
39670,"They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now."
39701,"He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down."
39735,The money's already been passed to do that.
39744,Take a look at North Carolina.
39745,"They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially."
39746,"We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen."
39764,"Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was."
39765,"We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, 'don't wear masks.'"
39787,And then you bring up Wall Street?
39792,We have plenty of money.
39827,"I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO."
39856,"They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse."
39864,Maybe you can do it right now.
39866,I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.
39879,"And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world."
39880,And China's building a new road to a new gas... a golf course you have overseas.
39894,They think I may have to pay tax.
39899,And it wasn't written whenever they write this.
39903,"I don't make money from Ukraine, you do."
39904,I don't make money from Russia.
39926,It's called prepaying your taxes.
39963,"Not a single thing, number one."
40020,That's the way I will run it.
40023,"Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this."
40055,He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues.
40062,They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymont.
40069,That's a typical political statement.
40087,We have a different kind of a relationship.
40092,Because he's not going to do that.'
40106,"If not, it's going to continue.'"
40155,"But then I made a decision, 'Run it as well as you can' - to my people, great people - 'Run it as well as you can.'"
40160,"No matter how well you run it, it's no good."
40187,What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option - become Bidencare.
40220,"And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters."
40222,Less than four years ago.
40239,It's the same thing with socialized medicine.
40241,My response is people deserve to have affordable health care - period.
40257,"- it was impossible to work, it doesn't work -"
40262,"Joe Biden, he's running against."
40263,"And the idea that we're in a situation and are going to destroy Medicare - this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, 'If in fact' - and, social security - 'If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to make up for it."
40330,This HEROES Act has been sitting there.
40340,"It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities."
40344,"But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country."
40351,"What I see is American, United States."
40353,"They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue."
40413,Let me just tell you.
40467,"I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it's and it's illegal."
40468,"You say 'Oh, no, Mom, leave me here."
40477,"And I've changed without having a specific - we got rid of catch and release, we got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with."
40517,So we don't have to worry about it.
40531,And she's written a lot about this.
40536,"But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, yes sir, no sir, hands on top of the wheel."
40549,"It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence."
40554,"And again, he's been in government 47 years."
40586,"There's not enough people in jail,' and go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, 'not enough people'."
40588,"This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty."
40595,"And one of these things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law."
40618,I am anxious to have this race.
40620,I am - the character of the country is on the ballot.
40626,"If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq - If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician."
40637,"Look, there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan."
40647,You have to be kidding.
40666,I don't know what to say.
40668,"I mean, they can say anything."
40670,"I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience."
40675,He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he's gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists.
40711,That's what we've been trying to do.
40715,"See, it's all talk, no action with these politicians."
40727,We have - there were over 1000 people who were given clemency.
40736,I'm going to do this.'
40740,You had eight years with Obama?
40762,And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years.
40785,We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years.
40789,"Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs."
40797,"This from Wall Street and I'll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy."
40800,"If you look at what he wants to do, you know the, if you look at his plan, his environmental plan, you know who developed it?"
40806,"If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that."
40828,"Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breathe."
40833,"We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I'm proposing."
40839,I know more about wind than you do.
40842,"And the fumes coming up - if you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make - make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean."
40847,It's not powerful enough yet to - to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world -
40849,"So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do?"
40850,We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world.
40919,We actually do give it to solar and wind--
40926,Will you remember that Pennsylvania?
40948,"But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me."
40952,The other side wanted to get together.
40969,We're going to choose science over fiction.
40970,We're going to choose hope over fear.
40973,We can deal with systemic racism.
40974,"At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs."
41038,We need to send Joe Biden back to his basement and reverse American decline.
41042,We -- we also cannot succeed when the Congress spends trillions and trillions of dollars.
41044,"And, finally, we need to lower your gas prices."
41045,We're going to open up all energy production.
41058,"And we still, through hard, strong decision-making, brought them around to our point of view."
41074,It was over 10 percent when I became governor in 2010.
41082,"Well, thank you for the question."
41109,"So, I don't know if I get a chance to respond."
41122,I have gone on to found multibillion dollar companies.
41123,"I did it while I married my wife Apoorva, raising our two sons, following our faith in God."
41136,What I care about the fact is that no one is telling the American people the truth.
41169,"Now, Martha, you asked earlier who is the most best prepared for this job?"
41183,-- and when I was Vice President.
41193,"But, I'll let you all parse that out."
41205,Now is not the time for on-the-job training.
41236,"And the reality is, you have a bunch of people, professional politicians, super PAC puppets, following slogans handed over to them by their 400-page super PACs last week."
41238,"Do you want a super PAC puppet, or do you want a patriot who speaks the truth?"
41247,Can I address the COVID issues the Governor brought up?
41268,"So, if you buy a battery in this country, you buy a solar panel, it's being produced in a plant in China powered by coal where it's being powered by oil and gas at 20 percent off."
41276,We have 14 percent fewer state employees in Arkansas after I left the government than when I took over as governor eight years ago.
41278,And I pledge to reduce it by 10 percent our federal nondefense workforce.
41281,"But let me tell you, I've been a federal prosecutor."
41313,Let's just answer the question.
41320,"No, I didn't -- I didn't raise my hand."
41353,"And the right way is first of all, yes, is climate change real?"
41358,"And so, that's not helping the environment."
41376,"I came to the conclusion that America can do for anyone what she's done for me if we focus on restoring hope, creating opportunities and protecting America."
41416,And can't we all agree that we are not going to put a woman in jail or give her the death penalty if she gets an abortion?
41432,"I know a lady in Florida named Penny, she survived multiple abortion attempts."
41440,I understand Iowa and New Hampshire are going to do different.
41441,But I will support the cause of life as governor and as president.
41458,It's supported by 70 percent of the American people.
41469,We haven't had 45 pro-life senators in over 100 years.
41470,"So no Republican president can ban abortions, any more than a Democrat president could ban all those state laws."
41490,"And this issue is, of course, very important."
41495,"The rest are left to the states comma, or importantly or to the people."
41526,And it is the most important issue for women and for the unborn child and for our country that we get this right.
41529,How we have to enhance maternal care.
41567,"I mean, it's extraordinary to think about the violence that's claiming innocent lives literally every week in every major city in this country."
41569,What we need is -- is strong commitment to law enforcement.
41576,We will bring our cities back.
41588,"So, what a President Christie would do is appoint an Attorney General who would instruct each of the 93 US attorneys that they are to take over the prosecution of violent crime in every one of those cities that are failing to do so."
41590,"Secondly, what we need to make sure that each and every one of these criminals understand is that the laws apply to everybody, and when Hunter Biden fills out a fake application, a false application, for a gun permit, and then is facing a 10-year mandatory minimum, which was mandated by legislation sponsored by his father, and then you have a Justice Department that walks away from those charges."
41595,"So, the reality is, we have a crime wave in this country, and we know how to fix it."
41600,Do we have the spine to bring them back?
41616,"We don't have an identity crisis, Vivek."
41617,We're not looking for a new national identity.
41619,We just need government as good as our people.
41647,"Bret and Martha, I just thought it's interesting, you asked your question about the problems we're having in big cities."
41658,"One, enforce the law when it comes to crime."
41665,"And so, we have to have respect for our justice system and the rule of law."
41687,Here's the -- here's the bottom line.
41703,We're skating on thin ice and we cannot set a precedent where the party in power uses police force to indict its political opponents.
41725,... and law and order.
41735,"Look, I -- no, no."
41760,"I will always stand up for our Constitution, regardless of the political pressure."
41778,Seventeen percent of Republicans have confidence in our Department of Justice.
41784,"You have to shut down the FBI, actually have the courage to get it right."
41798,"Here -- I know, but here's the thing."
41800,This election is not about January 6 of 2021.
41817,"We have answered this so many times, is the thing."
41841,"More people are understanding the importance of that, including conservative legal scholars, who says he may be disqualified under the 14th Amendment from being President, again, as a result of the insurrection."
41848,"OK, I'd like to answer."
41852,And he deserves not grudging credit.
41861,And I do think that we need to give him credit for that.
41862,"But what I will also tell you is, look, I mean, when it comes to whether President Trump should serve or not, I trust the American people let them vote, let them decide."
41864,We have to look at the fact that three quarters of Americans don't want a rematch between Trump and Biden.
41866,We can't win a general election that way.
41894,"Well, Mike, why don't you say this?"
41898,I'm the only candidate on this stage when the  say it.
41899,That is how we move our nation forward.
41907,"If I'm president in the United States, we'll get fair consideration of any pardon request."
41913,"And it ended with a prayer, so help me God."
41936,"I mean, I would have Europe step up and do their job."
41948,"And I find it offensive, that we have professional politicians on the stage that will make a pilgrimage to Kyiv, to their Pope, Zelenskyy, without doing the same thing for people in Maui or the Southside of Chicago or Kensington."
41956,"And I went to Ukraine, because I wanted to see for myself, what Vladimir Putin's army was doing to the free Ukrainian people."
41960,"They have gouged out people's eyes, cut off their ears and shot people in the back of the head, men, and then gone into those homes and raped the -- the daughters and the wives who were left as widows and orphans."
41974,"Vivek, if we do the giveaway that you want to give to Putin to give him his land, is not going to be too long for he rolls across a NATO border."
41975,"And frankly, our men and women of our armed forces are going to have to go and fight him."
41988,... has been saying he wants to reestablish the old Soviet sphere of influence.
41989,"You've -- you've made your point, Vice President."
41995,And we are driving Russia further into China's arms.
42020,"And I think that the same people that took us into Iraq War, the same people who took us into the Vietnam War, you cannot end -- you not start another no-win war."
42025,That will be my top priority...
42054,"When I was at the U.N., the Russian ambassador suddenly died."
42074,Do you want to go and give Ukraine to Russia?
42090,And you know what friends do?
42091,Friends help each other stand on their own two feet.
42093,I will partner with Israel to make sure Iran never is nuclear-armed.
42118,And we can do both at the same time.
42122,We're going to use force and we're going to leave them stone-cold dead.
42134,"And we act like that letting Russia win in the Ukraine is like a gimme, as opposed to a gift to China."
42141,"But the Biden administration sends Blinken, Yellen over there."
42144,"And what we need to do is not meetings, not press releases, because something that would send a lot more than a press release is actually harpoon missiles."
42168,"And, as the next president of the United States, I will make that border wall complete."
42202,We cannot be successful going against the cartel unless we bring in Mexico as a partner.
42228,I have met Angel Moms throughout this country.
42232,"So, as president, would I use force?"
