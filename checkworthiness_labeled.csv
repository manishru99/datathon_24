50,"I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention.",No
52,"But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.",No

58,"But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",No

77,"Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.",Yes
78,But we also have to take demand seriously.,No
81,And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.,Yes
82,We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.,No
83,"And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.",No
84,"And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances.",No

96,Panama is a friendly country.,No
97,"I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.",Yes
98,And we want to bring him to justice.,No
99,And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.,No
105,"Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.",No
106,"And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.",Yes
107,"First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.",No
111,Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.,No
114,It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.,No
115,I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.,No
116,"We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.",Yes
117,"We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.",No
118,The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.,No
119,"He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.",Yes
120,He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.,No
121,"If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.",No

133,"When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.",No
136,It's not going to cost the government money.,No
138,So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.,No
139,"Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.",Yes
142,"And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.",No
148,I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.,No
151,"I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.",Yes
153,I would like a balanced budget amendment.,No
154,But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.,Yes
155,So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.,No
156,It is that we are continuing to spend too much.,No
158,Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.,No
159,"And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.",Yes
160,And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.,No

163,"And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.",No
165,"Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.",No
166,"A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.",No
168,"Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.",No
173,"It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.",No
180,I want to keep this economic recovery going.,No
181,"More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.",Yes
182,What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.,No
183,I believe that's the answer.,No
186,But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.,No
187,"So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.",No
188,"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it.""",No
189,And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.,No
191,There isn't any such thing as something free out there.,No
192,It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.,No
193,"So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.",No
194,I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.,No
195,I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.,No
197,But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.,No
199,"But, George, that's no answer.",No
201,"Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.",Yes
208,And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.,No
209,That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.,No
217,Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.,No
221,"Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.",No
226,Let me say this about AIDS.,No
230,But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.,No
231,"In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.",No
232,The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.,No
233,I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.,No
235,"Well, we're on the right track.",No
239,But we got to have a knowledge base.,No
241,We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.,No
243,"And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.",No
244,We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.,No
245,"So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.",No
259,"Well, I don't question his passion.",No
260,I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.,No
261,He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.,Yes
263,He - we have a big difference on issues.,No
265,"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87.",No
266,"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.""",No
271,And I wish we had time to let me explain.,No
272,But I salute him for his passion.,No
273,"We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.",No
282,But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.,No
283,"But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.",No
287,I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.,No
290,I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.,No
291,"I don't want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don't want to see ""under God"" come out from our currency.",No
292,"Now, these are all positions of the ACLU.",No
293,And I don't agree with them.,No
294,"He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal.",No
295,I don't agree with that.,No
297,And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.,No
299,"You see, I'd have found a way to sign that bill.",No
300,Governor Thompson of Illinois did.,No
301,I'm not questioning his patriotism.,No
303,And then all the liberal columnists join in.,No
307,"And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.",No
308,And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.,No
311,"Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism.",No
312,"I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it.",No
314,My parents came to this country as immigrants.,No
322,"Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.",No
324,"I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.",No
326,"Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.",No
333,I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.,No
334,I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.,No
335,"I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help.",No
336,The governor's wife has been very active in the homeless.,No
337,"My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.",No
339,"These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.",No
340,The government has a role.,No
342,There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.,Yes
345,I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.,No
346,"I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.",No
347,They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.,No
349,"But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.",No
350,I'd say around 30 percent.,No
351,And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.,No
352,Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.,No
353,Because there is a major problem there.,No
354,A lot of them are mentally sick.,No
355,And we've got to attend to them.,No
356,"But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.",No
358,"Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.",Yes
359,"The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.",Yes
360,"And when you do that, you've have homeless families.",No
361,"We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.",Yes
362,We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.,No
363,We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.,No
365,And I think the housing community is ready.,No
366,"But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.",No
367,"And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do.",No
368,"We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.",No
375,Mr. Bush talked about values.,No
378,"Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?",No
383,"Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.",No
386,"I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.",No
389,But governors are ready; mayors are ready.,No
390,Builders and community leaders are ready.,No
391,"It will require some funds, John.",No
392,And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.,No
393,"But that, too, will require some choices.",No
395,"Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?",No
396,"Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.",No
397,Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.,No
398,"Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.",No
399,"And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.",No
400,"We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.",No
405,"When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?",No
407,"Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?",No
409,We are serving a million more families now.,Yes
414,I want to see more vouchers.,No
415,"I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.",No
421,"No, I don't think there is.",No
422,"There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.",No
423,I'm opposed to the death penalty.,No
424,I think everybody knows that.,No
425,I'm also very tough on violent crime.,No
426,And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.,Yes
427,It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.,Yes
429,"You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.",Yes
430,"The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.",No
434,The question is who makes the decision.,No
435,"And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",No
439,The federal program doesn't do that.,Yes
440,No other state programs do that.,Yes
441,And I favor the death penalty.,No
442,I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.,No
443,"But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.",No
444,And I do believe it would be inhibiting.,No
447,And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.,No
450,I do not favor abortion.,No
457,I haven't sorted out the penalties.,No
460,"And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.",No
461,"And you see, yes, my position has evolved.",No
464,"Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.",No
470,"Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.",No
471,It's as simple as that.,No
477,"Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.",No
478,I respect his right to disagree with me.,No
488,"But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.",No
491,I think it is good.,No
492,"I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.",No
494,"The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.",No
497,And so it's a combination of these things.,No
498,But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.,No
499,"The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.",No
500,I'm for Head Start and moving that up.,No
501,"And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.",No
503,"So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",No
508,Let me just give you one other example.,No
511,"It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.",Yes
512,That's the way you help people.,No
513,"Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.",No
514,I know what strong political leadership is.,No
515,I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.,No
522,Welfare reform is one way to do it.,No
524,That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.,No
526,One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.,No
527,Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.,No
528,"And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.",Yes
530,"Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.",No
533,But it takes presidential leadership.,No
534,It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.,No
535,And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.,No
538,This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.,No
539,They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.,No
540,The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.,Yes
542,But here's the point he misses.,No
547,And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.,No
549,"But it's not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.",No
556,Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.,No
560,Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.,No
561,It's not the length of your resume.,No
562,"It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.",No
563,"It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.",No
564,The vice president has a long resume.,No
565,But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.,No
571,"The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.",No
574,"I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.",Yes
575,But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.,No
578,"Well, I thought the question was about defense.",No
580,"And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.",Yes
586,But now we have a chance.,No
587,"I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.",No
588,"And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.",No
590,It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.,Yes
596,And he just lifted martial law.,Yes
598,And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.,No
604,I don't think it's a question of eliminating.,No
605,I can tell him some I'm against.,No
608,And I can go on and on.,No
610,"I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.",No
612,"And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is.",No
614,We're going to have to do that.,No
618,I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.,No
619,wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?,No
620,"These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference.",No
621,"Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces.",No
622,But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.,No
623,We will do what we do best.,No
627,I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.,No
629,But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.,No
630,And I think I've had that.,No

654,"And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off.",No
661,And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.,No
662,You see the turmoil in Poland today.,No
663,And I think we have enormous opportunity for trade.,No

671,The Reagan-Bush administration was right.,No

693,"No, there's been no change of heart.",No
695,"But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack.",Yes
701,We know where you're cutting right now.,No
702,You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.,No
705,"Coast Guard cutters tied up at the dock this summer, not patrolling.",Yes
707,You have to make choices.,No
709,"And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all.",No
710,"We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent.",No
711,"We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over.",Yes
713,"So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down.",No
714,But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.,No
715,That's-at least that's what I read.,No
716,Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.,No
718,I'm not reconsidering my position.,No

723,Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.,No

728,"I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can.",No
730,That is my position on SDI and it's never wavered a bit.,Yes
737,"Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make.",No
740,"But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever.",No
741,"Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us.",No

746,We've got to be tough on international terrorism.,No
747,We've got to treat it as international crime.,No

755,"Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages.",No

843,And he will do very very well.,No
844,And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30's and 40's and more.,No
845,"So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name.",No
847,"Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.",No

850,"Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal.",No
851,I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.,No

899,"I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument.",No
900,"But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job.",No
908,And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.,No
909,But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.,Yes
911,And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.,Yes
912,"I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time.",No

914,"I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers.",No
915,But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.,No
923,"In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan.",No
924,"I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding.",No
926,"I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged.",No
927,"But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market.",No
928,Let's try to expand our markets abroad.,No

968,"Yes, it's a tough problem as Mr. Bush says, but it's not an insolvable problem.",No
969,"It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values.",No

974,The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind.,No
975,We live-we bring everybody along.,No
976,And the best America is not behind us.,No
1004,"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.",No
1005,"Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces.",No
1006,"I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific.",No
1007,The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.,No
1008,I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.,No
1009,"I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.",No
1010,"And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.",No
1013,"Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.",No
1015,"overlapping, aren't those the real costs?",No
1016,"No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.",Yes
1017,Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent.,No
1018,But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.,No
1021,"With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America.",No
1022,"Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable.",No
1023,These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.,No
1026,Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.,No
1027,Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.,Yes
1028,The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process.,No
1029,If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.,No
1030,The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.,No
1031,"And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.",No
1032,"I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.",No
1033,"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country.""",No
1034,"I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.",No
1035,Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.,No
1038,"At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.",Yes
1040,"But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.",No
1042,I think the American people are too.,No
1049,I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.,Yes
1050,"When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.",Yes
1051,"Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.",No
1052,And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.,No
1053,I - I have to say that my campaign has been an open one.,No
1055,I don't know how to deal with it exactly.,No
1056,"Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.",Yes
1057,"But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.",No
1058,"If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.",No
1059,"But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.",No
1061,"I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days.",No
1064,"I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons.",No
1065,"We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.",No
1066,They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.,No
1069,"But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.",No
1072,"But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.",No
1078,"Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked.",No
1079,"And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.",Yes
1081,"I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.",Yes
1086,"But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes.",Yes
1087,"Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say ""yes"" or ""no.""",No
1088,"But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.",No
1089,I think the matter is settled once and for all.,No
1093,That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.,No
1110,"One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China.",No
1112,"Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.",No
1113,"The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.",No
1117,I certainly hope it won't.,No
1118,"I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.",No
1127,It's a fact they did.,Yes
1129,"It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do.",No
1130,"And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.",No
1141,"It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.",No
1144,"He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.",No
1145,"And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.",No
1146,"Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.",Yes
1151,I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.,No
1155,"This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.",No
1163,I don't believe it does.,No
1165,"At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.",No
1166,Uh - very few people knew who I was.,No
1167,"I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money.",No
1168,"And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.",No
1169,"And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.",No
1170,"And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.",No
1171,"Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.",No
1173,And they're very fine and very highly qualified.,No
1174,"The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.",No
1175,I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.,No
1178,"And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.",No
1180,"I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?",No
1181,I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.,No
1183,But I think this is indicative of what I would do.,No
1185,"The Governor may not have heard my uh - established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh - it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States.",No
1186,"And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.",No
1189,"I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.",No
1205,"I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.",Yes
1207,"So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would've interfered with our energy independence program.",Yes
1208,"The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.",Yes
1209,But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.,No
1212,Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.,Yes
1213,"For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.",Yes
1215,"And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.",Yes
1217,"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.",No
1224,We have no energy policy.,Yes
1226,The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.,No
1229,"But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future.",No
1231,"And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.",Yes
1239,"Yes, I'd be glad to.",No
1241,"It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.",No
1243,"This has not been done, unfortunately.",No
1244,"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead.""",No
1245,I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.,No
1247,Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.,No
1249,"Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.",No
1250,"Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.",No
1252,"When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.",Yes
1253,That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.,Yes
1256,"We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.",Yes
1257,"And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost.",No
1259,And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.,No
1261,"Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.",No
1265,"I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.",Yes
1266,In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.,Yes
1267,"In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars.",Yes
1269,We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.,No
1280,"You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility.",Yes
1282,"Uh - the Department of uh - uh - HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh - outlaws, that takes care of redlining.",Yes
1283,"Uh - what we're doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh - where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify.",No
1287,"I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record.",No

1296,The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.,Yes
1297,"Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year.",Yes
1299,And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.,No
1300,We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.,Yes
1301,"And there's been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language.",No
1302,"And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future.",No
1304,It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.,No
1305,And that's been lacking in the last eight years.,No
1312,"Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between.",No
1313,In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.,No
1314,We - quite often we have a transient problem.,No
1315,I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.,No
1317,I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.,No
1318,But I don't favor a constitutional amendment on the subject.,No
1319,"But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures.",No
1320,"I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment.",No
1321,"However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion.",No
1322,"But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them.",No
1328,Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.,No
1330,"Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right.",No
1331,"So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters.",No
1332,"I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe.",No
1333,"And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly.",No
1334,But they're matters that are ah - important.,No
1335,"And in those two cases, I would favor them.",No
1344,"What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.",No
1345,If we make the use of a gun in the commission.,No
1346,"of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.",No
1347,I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.,No
1348,"That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.",No
1350,"And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.",No
1357,And uh - the individuals that uh - with whom I've consulted have not uh - convinced me that uh - a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about.,No
1358,The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.,No
1361,You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.,No
1362,"And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.",No
1366,And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.,No
1367,"I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.",No
1368,"And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.",Yes
1369,"I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.",No
1370,But that's as far as I would go with it.,No
1376,"While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.",Yes
1377,"We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.",No
1378,"And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.",Yes
1379,"Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.",Yes
1381,So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.,No
1382,"And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.",No
1384,"Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.",Yes
1385,"The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.",No
1386,The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.,No
1387,Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.,Yes
1389,But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.,Yes
1395,"Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.",No
1396,"If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it.",No
1403,But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.,No
1404,And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.,No
1407,"I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.",No
1409,"So, I would say somebody in the format of uh - Justice Stevens would be the kind of an individual that I would uh - select in the future, as I did him in the past.",No
1410,"I uh - believe, however, a comment ought to be made about the direction of the uh - Burger Court, vis-a-vis the uh - court uh - that preceded it.",No
1412,"The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.",Yes
1413,"Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.",Yes
1418,"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.",No
1419,And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.,No
1421,"Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.",Yes
1423,"Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.",Yes
1424,"But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.",No
1425,But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.,No
1426,We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.,Yes
1428,"As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.",Yes
1431,"The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.",Yes
1439,"Uh Mr. Kraft, uh - I think the record can be put in this uh - in this way, which uh - is the way that I think satisfies most Americans.",No
1444,It means that there will be a reduction in the uhh - unemployment.,No
1445,It means that there will be increased hires.,No
1446,It means that there will be increased employment.,No
1447,"Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.",Yes
1452,"We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.",No
1455,"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.",Yes
1456,We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.,Yes
1457,"Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs.",Yes
1458,"In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll.",Yes
1460,Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.,No
1461,One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.,No
1462,There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.,No
1465,Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.,Yes
1467,And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.,No
1470,And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.,Yes
1473,He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.,Yes
1476,That is a very serious indictment of this administration.,No
1477,It's probably the worst one of all.,No
1484,"Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened.",No
1489,"I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent.",Yes
1491,"And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day.",No
1492,"I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll.",No
1493,"As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list.",Yes
1497,"So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair.",No
1499,I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.,No
1501,"In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia.",Yes
1502,That's an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best.,No
1505,"I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs.",No
1506,But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.,No
1507,"And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment.",No
1510,"I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes.",No
1511,He tends to distort on a number of occasions.,No
1514,"We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.",Yes
1515,That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.,No
1519,We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.,Yes
1520,"If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less.",No
1521,"But this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military.",No
1522,"So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.",Yes
1523,They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.,No
1530,For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.,No
1535,"We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam.",Yes
1536,The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.,No
1539,But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years.,No
1540,"During this campaign we've seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh - slogans of one kind or another.",No
1541,But those are not the things that count.,No
1542,"What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth.",No
1544,"The American people are healed, are working together.",No
1545,"The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction.",No
1548,"There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright.",No
1549,I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised.,No
1551,Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight.,No
1552,We have peace with freedom.,No
1553,I've been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times.,No
1555,"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it.""",No
1559,Thank you Barbara (barely audible).,No
1563,We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.,No
1564,Sometimes we've been embarrassed and sometimes we've been ashamed.,No
1565,"Our people are out of work, and there's a sense of withdrawal.",No
1567,"Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office.",No
1568,"I'd like to ask the American people what, what's been accomplished.",No
1569,A lot remains to be done.,No
1572,I served an a hospital authority.,No
1574,"And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington.",No
1575,"Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed.",No
1577,We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.,Yes
1578,"As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia.",Yes
1579,"We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care.",Yes
1580,We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.,Yes
1584,Employment ought to be restored to our people.,No
1587,Our people wanna go back to work.,No
1588,Our education system can be improved.,No
1589,Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained.,No
1590,Our housing programs have uh - gone bad.,Yes
1592,But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.,Yes
1593,The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.,Yes
1594,"Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess.",No
1595,This doesn't have to be.,No
1598,"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now.""",No
1599,"I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things.",No
1601,There are no magic answers to do it.,No
1602,But I believe together we can make great progress.,No
1603,We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.,No
1605,We've been drifting too long.,No
1606,We've been dormant too long.,No
1608,And we have not set an example for our own people.,No
1609,"But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country.",No
1610,And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.,No
1612,"But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth.",No
1662,"And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back.",No
1666,But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do.,No
1667,"And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going.",No
1678,"I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.",No
1679,"And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary.",No
1688,"Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, ""Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs.",No
1689,He's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home.,No
1695,"One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent.",No
1710,"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.",No
1714,And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.,No
1716,But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.,No
1720,So all of this is possible.,No
1732,My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.,No
1734,High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.,No
1739,"Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.",Yes
1740,This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.,No
1743,"At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.",Yes
1751,Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.,No
1759,"And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.",No
1760,"But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.",Yes
1763,But not due to his policies.,No
1764,In spite of his policies.,No
1774,"My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.",No

1781,"Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.",Yes
1783,"We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.",Yes
1791,"But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.",No

1819,I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.,No
1825,There are all these studies out there.,No
1829,"And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?",No
1830,"And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.",Yes
1846,"But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.",Yes
1848,"And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.",No

1852,Donald Trump is a small business.,No
1853,"Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.",No

1879,"He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax.",No
1897,"So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.",No
1914,"My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.",No
1933,So how do we deal with it?,No
1934,"Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.",No
1936,Number two is to cut spending.,No
1942,I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.,No
1955,"I like PBS, I love Big Bird.",No
1962,This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.,No

2032,"Well, we've had this discussion before.",No
2041,That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.,No
2045,We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.,Yes
2077,"As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.",Yes
2083,"Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...",No
2088,"First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.",Yes
2089,"And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.",No
2092,"And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.",Yes
2102,"The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.",No
2107,But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.,No
2119,"But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.",No
2128,"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.",No
2130,It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.,No
2133,"You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.",No

2157,"Oh, I just thought about one.",No
2159,In fact he is on Medicare.,Yes
2162,"Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.",Yes
2165,That's saying we're cutting the rates.,No
2167,We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.,Yes

2179,"First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.",No
2197,"So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.",No

2211,So that's -- that's number one.,No
2214,They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.,No
2218,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.",No
2226,We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.,No
2229,"This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.",No
2235,"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.",No
2238,"And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.",No

2326,"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.",Yes
2328,"But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.",Yes

2334,That's why I'd have regulation.,No
2336,That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.,Yes
2340,Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.,No
2346,We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.,No
2349,It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.,Yes
2351,Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.,No
2377,"Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.",No
2381,"I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.",Yes

2394,"Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.",No
2400,And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.,Yes
2430,"It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.",No
2437,This was a bipartisan idea.,Yes
2444,"Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?",No
2445,And there are ways of doing it.,No
2448,"They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.",No
2452,"And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.",No
2455,"In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.",Yes
2456,Let me make one last point.,No
2460,"In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...",Yes

2470,"Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.",No

2481,"I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.",No
2482,I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.,No
2486,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.",No
2490,That's explicitly prohibited in the law.,Yes
2491,"But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.",Yes
2499,"Now, that also means that you've got more customers.",No
2501,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.",No
2507,Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?,No

2593,The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.,Yes
2602,But the federal government also can play a very important role.,No
2616,This seems to be a trend.,No
2617,"But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.",Yes
2630,"And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.",Yes
2631,And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.,No

2649,A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.,Yes
2651,"The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?",No
2657,"And by the way, I've had that experience.",No
2661,This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.,No
2684,"And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.",No
2689,But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.,No
2695,"But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.",No
2696,That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.,No
2703,"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan.",No

2719,"The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America.",Yes

2795,Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.,No

2800,"In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world.",No
2801,"We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.",No

2810,Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.,Yes
2811,This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.,No
2814,That's got to be changed.,No
2815,And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.,No

2830,You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.,No

2862,I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.,No
2867,That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country.,No

2900,"And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.",Yes
2903,"So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.",No

2967,"(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.",No
2969,The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.,No
2972,"We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.",Yes
2973,And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.,No

3009,It's a matter of being tough.,No
3010,It's a matter of being strong.,No

3014,And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.,Yes
3015,This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.,No
3021,I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.,Yes
3023,Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.,Yes

3055,"As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.",Yes
3058,And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.,No
3059,"There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.",No
3060,In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.,No
3062,But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.,No

3079,We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.,Yes
3080,And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.,No
3081,So strong economy is very important.,No
3082,Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.,No
3085,And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.,No
3087,Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.,No
3089,We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.,No
3095,"Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.",Yes
3097,The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.,Yes
3099,I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.,No
3100,"But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.",No
3103,Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.,No
3104,In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.,Yes
3105,He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.,Yes
3106,Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.,No
3107,Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.,No
3108,"As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.",Yes
3113,I was the first United States president to visit Japan.,No
3115,You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.,No
3116,"Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.",Yes
3126,"As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.",Yes
3131,"In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.",Yes
3132,Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.,Yes
3136,"So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.",No
3140,"They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.",No
3145,"Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time.",No
3153,I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.,Yes
3158,We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.,Yes
3160,This has got to be stopped.,No
3166,"No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.",No
3167,I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.,No
3168,I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.,No
3169,"But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.",No
3171,And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.,No
3172,We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.,Yes
3175,And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.,No
3176,"So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.",No
3178,Under this administration that strength has not been realized.,No
3182,Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.,No
3184,"But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.",No
3186,The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.,No
3187,"What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?",No
3188,What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?,Yes
3190,"What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?",No
3191,Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.,No
3205,"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.",No
3206,"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.",No
3207,"So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.",No
3208,And I believe that we used our skill.,No
3212,"This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.",No
3214,There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.,No
3217,And we will do it with the highest moral principles.,No
3220,"I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.",No
3221,Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.,No
3223,But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.,No
3224,"On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.",Yes
3225,South Korea faces a very delicate situation.,No
3227,"This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.",No
3230,"This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.",Yes
3231,This has not been an ancient history story.,No
3232,"Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.",Yes
3233,Another point I wanna make is this.,No
3236,"While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.",No
3238,"Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.",Yes
3242,I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.,No
3244,And the last thing I wanna make is this.,No
3245,He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.,No
3247,"But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.",Yes
3257,Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.,Yes
3259,"I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.",No
3263,I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.,No
3265,"I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.",No
3267,The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.,No
3268,The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.,No
3269,And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.,No
3270,The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.,Yes
3271,I believe those negotiations should continue.,No
3272,"But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them.",No
3280,The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.,Yes
3281,"On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.",Yes
3284,"Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.",No
3285,And let me make another observation.,No
3286,"This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.",No
3288,"And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.",No
3293,Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.,No
3294,We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.,Yes
3295,Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.,No
3296,"But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.",No
3297,And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.,No
3300,I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.,No
3301,Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.,No
3302,He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.,Yes
3303,I understand that the report today is accurate.,No
3305,I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.,No
3306,"I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.",Yes
3307,"I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.",No
3310,"When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.",No
3311,"But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.",No
3316,This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.,Yes
3318,It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.,No
3320,"And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.",No
3325,Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.,No
3327,"And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott.",Yes
3328,And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.,Yes
3329,Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.,Yes
3332,"Because the Congress failed to act, I am going to announce tomorrow that the Department of Commerce will disclose those companies that have uh - participated in the Arab boycott.",No
3336,Let me restate uh - our policy.,No
3341,"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars.",Yes
3342,This is what the families of MIAs want.,No
3347,"I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action.",No
3355,"The purpose of this debate and the outcome of the election will determine three basic things: Leadership, upholding the principles of our country, and proper priorities and commitments for the future.",No
3356,This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.,No
3357,"Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?",Yes
3358,"Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?",No
3360,"Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?",No
3361,Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?,No
3362,Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?,No
3363,I believe we can and we ought to.,No
3364,Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.,No
3370,Why can't we have that once again?,No
3375,It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.,No
3376,"It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States.",No
3378,"As we have seen tonight, foreign policy and defense policy are difficult and complex issues.",No
3379,"We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results.",No
3386,"Thank you, and good night.",No
3423,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight.",No
3428,"And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?",No
3432,"So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.",No
3435,"Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns.",No
3438,"Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.",Yes
3445,And I do have a sad note tonight.,No
3449,I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.,No
3455,And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.,No
3457,"But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package.",Yes
3462,"And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives.",No
3467,"This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable.",No
3470,"And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.",No
3478,We haven't seen the language yet.,No
3480,"So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan.",No
3487,We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.,No
3503,Somehow we've lost that accountability.,No
3504,I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.,Yes
3506,"But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.",No
3508,And I promise you that that will happen.,No
3526,We haven't been paying attention to them.,No
3538,"But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America.",No
3543,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.",No
3544,It's completely out of control.,No
3546,"We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.",No
3549,And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.,Yes
3563,"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.",Yes
3564,"And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.",Yes
3568,"And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.",Yes
3571,"And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.",No
3572,"And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.",No
3578,"He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.",Yes
3582,Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?,Yes
3585,"That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.",No
3586,It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.,No
3606,But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.,No
3607,"And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.",Yes
3616,It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.,Yes
3617,"I can tell you, it's rife.",No
3626,"I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich.""",No
3628,"Well, let me just make a couple of points.",No
3635,It's not like you want to close the loopholes.,No
3639,"Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.",Yes
3642,"And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.",No
3644,"But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.",No
3654,You've got to look at our records.,No
3658,Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?,No
3682,"The economy is slowing down, so it's hard to anticipate right now what the budget is going to look like next year.",Yes
3685,"We have to have energy independence, so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel, making sure that we're developing the fuel-efficient cars of the future right here in the United States, in Ohio and Michigan, instead of Japan and South Korea.",No
3688,"They are getting crushed, and many of them are going bankrupt as a consequence of health care.",Yes
3691,The third thing we have to do is we've got to make sure that we're competing in education.,No
3697,"Also, making sure that we have a new electricity grid to get the alternative energy to population centers that are using them.",No
3699,We can't shortchange those things.,No
3700,"We've got to eliminate programs that don't work, and we've got to make sure that the programs that we do have are more efficient and cost less.",No
3702,"Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending.",No
3710,We now have defense systems that the costs are completely out of control.,Yes
3714,I know how to do that.,No
3715,I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong.,Yes
3725,That is a big project.,No
3730,We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system.,Yes
3744,I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions of caring for our veterans national defense and several other vital issues.,No
3746,The problem with a spending freeze is you're using a hatchet where you need a scalpel.,No
3754,"We have to have wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power.",No
3765,"Not only -- Even if we get all $700 billion back, let's assume the markets recover, we're holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit.",Yes
3766,"If we're lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term there's an outlay and we may not see that money for a while.",No
3768,"The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who we're fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure we're not shortchanging our long term priorities.",No
3778,And spending restraint has got to be a vital part of that.,No
3781,"And spending, I know, can be brought under control because I have fought against excessive spending my entire career.",No
3784,"John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending.",Yes
3806,And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.,No
3808,The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence.,No
3813,"And we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home.",Yes
3822,"We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be $1 trillion.",Yes
3824,"We have seen 30,000 wounded, and most importantly, from a strategic national security perspective, al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.",Yes
3835,"Recently on a television program, he said it exceed our wildest expectations.",No
3836,"But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today.",Yes
3839,Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan.,No
3853,"They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.",No
3854,"But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.",No
3856,You talk about the surge.,No
3860,You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators.,No
3869,I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand the difference between a tactic and a strategy.,No
3885,"There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you.",No
3892,And that same strategy will be employed in Afghanistan by this great general.,No
3893,"And Senator Obama, who after promising not to vote to cut off funds for the troops, did the incredible thing of voting to cut off the funds for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.",Yes
3894,"Jim, there are a whole bunch of things we have got to answer.",No
3897,"I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush.",Yes
3898,We had a difference on the timetable.,Yes
3900,"We had a legitimate difference, and I absolutely understand the difference between tactics and strategy.",No
3901,And the strategic question that the president has to ask is not whether or not we are employing a particular approach in the country once we have made the decision to be there.,No
3904,We need more troops there.,No
3908,There is nobody who can pose a threat to us there.,No
3919,What he said was a precipitous...,No
3922,He did not say that.,No
3926,"Now General Petraeus has praised the successes, but he said those successes are fragile and if we set a specific date for withdrawal -- and by the way, Senator Obama's original plan, they would have been out last spring before the surge ever had a chance to succeed.",Yes
3927,And I'm -- I'm -- understand why Senator Obama was surprised and said that the surge succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.,No
3929,"But if we snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and adopt Senator Obama's plan, then we will have a wider war and it will make things more complicated throughout the region, including in Afghanistan.",No
3937,"And I think that we have to do it as quickly as possible, because it's been acknowledged by the commanders on the ground the situation is getting worse, not better.",Yes
3945,"So here's what we have to do comprehensively, though.",No
3955,So we can't ignore those lessons of history.,No
3967,I can see how tough that terrain is.,No
3969,"And, yes, Senator Obama calls for more troops, but what he doesn't understand, it's got to be a new strategy, the same strategy that he condemned in Iraq.",Yes
3977,So we've got a lot of work to do in Afghanistan.,No
3987,"Now, I think that's the right strategy; I think that's the right policy.",No
4001,That's going to change when I'm president of the United States.,No
4002,I -- I don't think that Senator Obama understands that there was a failed state in Pakistan when Musharraf came to power.,Yes
4007,"Tragically, I was right: Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks.",Yes
4008,And then we had Somalia -- then we had the first Gulf War.,No
4009,I supported -- I supported that.,Yes
4011,"That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe.",No
4014,"And I have a record -- and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn -- turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of.",Yes
4019,"This was last August, a year ago.",No
4024,And they all say to me that we don't want defeat.,No
4030,"I've got a bracelet, too, from Sergeant - from the mother of Sergeant Ryan David Jopeck (ph), given to me in green bay.",No
4038,"At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can ""muddle through"" Afghanistan.",Yes
4040,You don't muddle through stamping out the Taliban.,No
4041,I think that is something we have to take seriously.,No
4047,I know what our needs are.,No
4048,"So the point is that we will prevail in Afghanistan, but we need the new strategy and we need it to succeed.",No
4059,"My reading of the threat from Iran is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and it is a threat to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well.",No
4061,Let's just make that very clear.,No
4072,Senator Obama said that would be provocative.,No
4074,"This is a serious threat to security in the world, and I believe we can act and we can act with our friends and allies and reduce that threat as quickly as possible, but have no doubt about the ultimate result of them acquiring nuclear weapons.",No
4087,"Senator McCain is absolutely right, we cannot tolerate a nuclear Iran.",No
4092,"I do not agree with Senator McCain that we're going to be able to execute the kind of sanctions we need without some cooperation with countries like Russia and China that are, I think Senator McCain would agree, not democracies, but have extensive trade with Iran but potentially have an interest in making sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon.",No
4093,"But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked.",No
4108,So he may not be the right person to talk to.,No
4112,This is one of your own advisers.,No
4113,"Now, understand what this means ""without preconditions.""",No
4117,"Of course we've got to do preparations, starting with low-level diplomatic talks, and it may not work, because Iran is a rogue regime.",No
4121,"Again, it may not work, but if it doesn't work, then we have strengthened our ability to form alliances to impose the tough sanctions that Senator McCain just mentioned.",No
4131,"When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground.",Yes
4135,Spain is a NATO ally.,No
4140,"Look, Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to- face meetings between the president of the United States and the president -- and Ahmadinejad.",No
4143,He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.,Yes
4145,The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.,No
4151,"By the way, North Korea, most repressive and brutal regime probably on Earth.",No
4153,"We don't know what the status of the dear leader's health is today, but we know this, that the North Koreans have broken every agreement that they've entered into.",Yes
4157,This is a mischaracterization of my position.,No
4160,And the notion that we would sit with Ahmadinejad and not say anything while he's spewing his nonsense and his vile comments is ridiculous.,No
4168,I've known him for 35 years.,No
4173,We do that all the time.,No
4177,I am not parsing words.,No
4192,"It is absolutely important that we have a unified alliance and that we explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship.",No
4193,"And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts.",No
4196,"Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia.",No

4203,"You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?",No
4206,"Well, I was interested in Senator Obama's reaction to the Russian aggression against Georgia.",No
4219,"And, of course, we know that the Russians control other sources of energy into Europe, which they have used from time to time.",Yes
4224,They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.,Yes
4227,"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president.""",No
4231,We want to work with the Russians.,No
4245,"So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.",No
4247,And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.,No
4259,"And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.",No
4268,"That's just not true, John.",No
4284,"And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.",No
4306,"I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.",Yes
4307,"But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.",Yes
4308,"And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.",Yes

4316,We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.,No
4318,"I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.",No
4323,"But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",No
4332,This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.,No
4335,"And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.",Yes
4341,We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.,No
4350,"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven.""",Yes
4359,And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.,No
4360,That is the central issue of our time.,No
4361,And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.,No
4364,"Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.",Yes
4372,They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.,Yes
4384,"So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.",No

4399,"But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.",No
4409,"And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.",No
5495,And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.,No
5515,Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.,No
5516,And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.,No
5519,So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.,No
5543,That's 16 million jobs in America.,Yes
5550,"And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.",Yes
5568,"The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.",Yes
5576,"Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.",Yes
5617,"And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.",Yes
5627,"If we invest in a serious energy policy, that will save in the amount of money we're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia.",No
5628,"If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college, that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century.",No
5634,I just want to get back to this home ownership.,No

5646,"It's wind, tide, solar, natural gas, nuclear, off-shore drilling, which Senator Obama has opposed.",Yes
5650,Some people say that's a hatchet.,No
5656,I know how to eliminate programs.,No
5660,I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.,Yes
5680,"There's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on, and they need to be eliminated.",No
5687,"And, frankly, Senator McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush's budgets.",Yes
5695,"Senator Obama, I am not President Bush.",No
5696,"If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.",No
5700,"Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget.",No
5707,... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence.,No
5721,"First of all, in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party, the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform, which wasn't very popular with trial lawyers, a major constituency in the Democratic Party.",Yes
5731,"So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.",Yes
5733,"But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.",No
5735,And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.,No
5747,Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient's bill of rights.,No
5765,"And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.",No
5767,But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.,No
5776,And I can prove it.,No
5777,"And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.",Yes
5792,"What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.",No
5793,And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.,No
5794,"Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.",Yes
5796,And that is something that I would welcome.,No
5797,"But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.",No
5805,"So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.",Yes
5806,"And of course, I've been talking about the economy.",No
5809,"And of course, we're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America.",No
5832,"Well, let me just say I would...",No
5835,"Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples.",No
5852,And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.,No
5854,"What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.",No
5855,And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.,No
5857,"Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.",No
5861,"But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship.",No

5878,And he will not advise me in the White House.,No
5880,"Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.",No
5896,"And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.",Yes
5899,And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.,No
5900,And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.,No
5925,"She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down, a $40 billion pipeline of natural gas that's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48.",Yes
5926,She's a reformer through and through.,No
5932,She understands that better than almost any American that I know.,No

5951,"In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries.",Yes
5952,"We're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis, tough, hard, but we're seeing them.",No
5970,"By the way, when Senator Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Canadians said, ""Yes, and we'll sell our oil to China.""",Yes
5976,"We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel, Senator Obama, no problem.",No
5982,I think that's about a realistic timeframe.,No
5999,In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.,No
6008,"He said, we will look at offshore drilling.",Yes
6011,We can offshore drill now.,Yes
6021,"Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.",Yes
6032,"And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.",No
6040,"Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.",Yes
6042,So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.,No
6048,"We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does.",Yes
6052,Neither of them have health insurance.,No
6053,"And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage, because, understandably, they're worried that, if they get sick, they could go bankrupt.",No
6054,So here's what my plan does.,No
6062,We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.,No
6069,"They're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up.",Yes
6071,"And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country.",No
6076,That will -- that will reduce costs.,No
6084,Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish.,No
6097,"And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.",No
6098,Here's your fine -- zero.,No
6103,"But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.",No
6118,"And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.",Yes
6137,Senator Obama wants government to do the job.,No
6148,You all just heard my plan.,No
6149,"If you've got an employer-based health care plan, you keep it.",No
6167,I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.,No
6174,You were offered a chance to join.,No
6176,I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.,Yes
6177,"Not because I agreed with their ideology, but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated.",No
6180,That's not the way we should judge these nominees.,No
6204,"And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn't know about it until fairly recently.",Yes
6206,I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.,Yes
6208,And that's the kind of judge that I want.,No
6212,Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.,No
6224,"And he'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate.",No
6225,"It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.",No
6230,There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade.,Yes
6240,"But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, ""We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.""",No
6248,He's health for the mother.,No
6251,"But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents.",No
6254,But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.,No
6264,"This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power.",No
6290,"We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people, after having served in the military, can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states.",No
6298,"Well, we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that's a tradition that has served us well.",No

6301,He put forward No Child Left Behind.,Yes
6305,Senator McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned.,No

6319,"I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided and there's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that.",Yes
6321,And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children.,No
6329,We need to sit down and reauthorize it.,No
6346,"But to have a situation, as you mentioned in our earlier comments, that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform, as well.",Yes
6349,"And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system.",No
6370,And it's great to be with you again.,No
6372,"My friends, as I said in my opening remarks, these are very difficult times and challenges for America.",No

6588,We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas.,No

6916,"And most importantly, we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care, they also get, whether they're self-employed or a small business, a lower cost to be able to cover their employees.",Yes
6924,They analyzed the senator's plan.,No
6926,"The Lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people, over 20 million people added to government-controlled health care.",Yes
6935,They have poor-quality health care.,No
6949,That's twice the amount that my predecessor increased VA funding.,Yes
6952,We're aligning facilities where the veterans live now.,Yes
6960,"First, let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when we're talking about reforming Social Security, that they'll still get their checks.",No
6967,"But for our children and our grandchildren, we need to have a different strategy.",No
6972,And the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the Social Security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren.,No
6976,And we're of course going to have to consider the costs.,No
6991,We paid down the debt for two years.,Yes
6994,I will not privatize it.,No
7006,We heard the same thing.,No
7018,And we'll make whatever adjustment is necessary.,No
7022,"Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has.",Yes
7024,"And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security.",No
7028,I heard more of the same.,No
7031,Most of the tax cuts went to low- and middle-income Americans.,Yes
7036,"If you're married, you got tax relief.",Yes
7048,"Sure, there's more work to do.",No
7071,They're coming here to work.,No
7072,"If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families.",No
7084,And we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line.,No
7087,"In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens.",Yes
7091,"The American middle-class family isn't making it right now, Bob.",No
7092,"And what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care, the increase in gasoline, the increase in tuitions, the increase in prescription drugs.",Yes
7107,"We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows.",No
7110,They're much better protected today than they were when I was the governor of Texas.,Yes
7119,And we're not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology.,No
7121,"We have thumbprint, fingerprint technology today.",No
7122,"We can know who the people are, that they're really the people they say they are when they cross the border.",No
7125,"The fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be, and I'll make them secure.",No
7132,It's long overdue time to raise the minimum wage.,No
7134,We have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years.,Yes
7135,But the Republican leadership of the House and Senate won't even let us have a vote on it.,Yes
7137,They don't want to raise the minimum wage.,No
7146,And we had an initiative that we were working on to raise women's pay.,Yes
7152,"And if we did that, we'd have more consumption ability in America, which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear.",No
7156,And that's to make sure the education system works.,No
7166,Children whose parents wouldn't speak English as a first language just move through.,No
7172,"You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom.",No
7188,I'll answer it straight to America.,No
7192,"Clearly, the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it.",Yes
7193,But let me go a step further.,No
7208,Absolutely we've got to make sure they get educated.,No
7209,He talked about children whose parents don't speak English as a first language?,No
7234,"In addition, I'm going to double the number of Special Forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror, with less pressure on the National Guard and Reserve.",No
7235,And what I would like to do is see the National Guard and Reserve be deployed differently here in our own country.,No
7238,And that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure.,No
7240,"I've said it before, I say it again: I believe the president broke faith with the American people in the way that he took this nation to war.",No
7242,"He said in Cincinnati we would plan carefully, we would take every precaution.",No
7247,And that is the result of this president taking his eye off of Osama bin Laden.,No
7262,We'll continue to build strong coalitions.,No
7274,Apparently you can't pass any test under his vision of the world.,No
7278,"Actually, I made my intentions -- made my views clear.",No
7281,I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns don't get in the hands of people that shouldn't have them.,No
7283,And that's why early in my administration I called the attorney general and the U. S. attorneys and said: Put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.,Yes
7285,Neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns.,No
7307,So I believe America's less safe.,No
7321,They don't reach those goals.,No
7327,"It also is with respect to women, it's with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country.",No
7330,"During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action.",No
7338,This is a president who hasn't met with the Black Congressional Caucus.,Yes
7391,I think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the Almighty.,No
7398,"There's one for the people who have, and there's one for the people who don't have.",No
7399,And we're struggling with that today.,No
7415,That's not where we are today.,No
7418,I've never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way they're locked out today.,No
7422,I think we have to come together and work to change it.,No
7428,"And one of the ways we're going to do it is, I'm going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America.",No
7435,But Washington is a tough town.,No
7436,"And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in.",No
7458,"""I said, ""OK, you've got a deal.",No

7465,"When I met her in the backyard at Joe and Jan O'Neill's in Midland, Texas, it was the classic backyard barbecue.",No
7475,And some would say maybe me more so than others.,No
7483,"And my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of what's right, what's wrong.",No
7488,They surely don't let me do that.,No
7489,"And I'm blessed, as I think the president is blessed, as I said last time.",No
7492,And I think we're both very lucky.,No
7508,"And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher.",No
7520,"And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene.",No

7533,"Over the next four years, we'll continue to rally the armies of compassion, to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our country's neighborhoods.",No
7582,"As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States.",No
7589,Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.,Yes
7592,And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.,Yes
7593,For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.,No
7594,"Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear.",No
7595,There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.,No
7598,"No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit.",No
7601,In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.,No
7602,"Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years.",Yes
7603,"Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections.",No
7605,"Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results.",Yes
7607,"I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution.",Yes
7613,In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.,No
7615,The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.,No
7617,"And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is.",Yes
7619,We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.,Yes
7623,"I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action.",No
7627,I believe we should have a stronger military force.,No
7628,I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.,No
7631,I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.,No
7635,The United States is a strong country.,No
7636,"Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.",No
7639,This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.,No
7640,We all remember Pearl Harbor.,No
7642,We cannot afford an intelligence gap.,No
7644,"I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort.",No
7645,And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.,No
7655,"And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership.",No
7656,"And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes.",No
7657,Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.,No
7658,I have talked to Negro mothers.,No
7660,"This is wrong, and we have to do something about it.",No
7662,Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.,Yes
7663,"Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?",No
7664,Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.,No
7667,"And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity.",No
7669,"Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?",No
7672,"He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia.",No
7675,These are the great questions: equality of education in school.,No
7677,Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.,Yes
7678,"These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know.",No
7681,What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?,No
7682,Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.,No
7683,And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.,No
7687,"From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.",No
7690,"Secondly, as an executive leader.",No
7691,There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.,Yes
7692,The right to vote is basic.,No
7693,I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.,Yes
7695,Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.,No
7697,"And then fourthly, as a moral leader.",No
7700,We need all the talent we can get.,No
7701,We sit on a conspicuous stage.,No
7703,We have to practice what we preach.,No
7704,We set a very high standard for ourselves.,No
7707,"We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards.",No
7708,I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.,No
7709,"Now lastly, I believe in the case of Little Rock.",No
7711,I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.,No
7713,I would hope an incident like that would not happen.,No
7714,"I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.",No
7716,"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.""",No
7719,"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.",No
7721,"When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.",Yes
7725,And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.,No
7726,"Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.",Yes
7727,All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.,No
7728,What we need is action.,No
7729,"And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.",No
7733,"Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.",No
7734,"And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.",No
7735,"Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.",No
7744,Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.,No
7745,That's a test of prestige.,No
7746,"Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.",Yes
7748,In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.,No
7749,"It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.",Yes
7751,What tools do we need to fight us?,No
7752,"Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.",No
7754,"I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.",Yes
7756,They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.,Yes
7757,"Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.",No
7758,So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.,No
7759,It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.,No
7760,But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.,No
7766,"Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.",No
7768,"Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.",Yes
7770,We have not maintained our position and our prestige.,No
7773,"The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.",Yes
7778,"The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.",Yes
7780,"And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.",Yes
7781,"Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.",Yes
7782,"We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.",Yes
7783,"I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.",No
7784,This permits them to maintain their self-respect.,No
7785,It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.,No
7786,And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.,No
7787,I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.,No
7790,"And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.",No
7792,I think the United States can afford to do these things.,No
7793,I think that we could not afford not to do these things.,No
7795,"And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.",No
7796,"I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.",No
7797,I believe we can do it.,No
7802,"But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.",No
7804,"We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.",No
7805,We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.,No
7808,"And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.",No
7809,The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.,No
7810,This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.,No
7811,We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.,No
7812,We must stand for our ideals.,No
7817,To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.,No
7819,Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.,Yes
7821,"So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.",No
7823,"Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.",No
7826,"If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.",No
7831,This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.,No
7832,I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.,No
7833,So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.,No
7837,I'm very familiar with it.,No
7840,"We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.",Yes
7841,We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.,Yes
7842,Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.,Yes
7846,I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.,Yes
7848,Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.,Yes
7849,"Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.",No
7850,"If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.",No
7851,One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.,No
7852,The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.,No
7858,The question is what we're going to do in the future.,No
7860,In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.,No
7861,I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.,No
7862,Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.,No
7864,"He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.",No
7870,That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.,No
7872,"Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.",No
7874,"In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.",No
7875,We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.,Yes
7881,I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.,No
7883,"Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.",No
7885,I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.,No
7886,Let me make my position cl ear.,No
7888,I'm proud of the record of this Administration.,No
7889,I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.,No
7891,But what does he offer?,No
7895,I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.,No
7896,I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.,No
7897,"And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.",No
7902,It would not be appropriate for me to do so.,No
7903,"The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.",No
7904,"As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.",No
7905,I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.,No
7906,"I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.",No
7907,We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.,No
7910,"Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.",No
7914,I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.,No
7915,It - my view is the same as his.,No
7916,Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.,No
7917,"That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.",No
7918,"If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.",No
7920,It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.,No
7922,"And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.",No
7931,"Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.",No
7932,"In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.",No
7933,"If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.",No
7934,I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.,No
7935,I'm talking about a national mood.,No
7936,I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.,No
7941,"If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.",No
7942,"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.",No
7943,So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.,No
7946,"And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.",No
7947,"And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.",No
7948,I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.,No
7950,Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.,No
7951,"Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.",No
7955,I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.,No
7956,But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.,No
7960,But it isn't going to be working that way.,No
7961,You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.,No
7971,And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?,No
7972,"In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China.",Yes
7973,In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.,Yes
7974,"I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong.",No
7976,I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.,No
7977,I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.,No
7980,"Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration.",No
7982,"We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history.",No
7983,"Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths.",No
7984,It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.,No
7985,Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.,No
7986,"And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way.",No
7987,"But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate.",No
7988,And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.,No
7990,"Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet.",Yes
7991,"Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet.",Yes
7993,Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.,No
7995,You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.,Yes
7997,And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.,No
7998,And we ought to try to meet the problem.,No
8002,"Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States.",Yes
8008,I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.,No
8009,"These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa.",No
8011,We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.,No
8012,But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.,No
8013,"Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible.",Yes
8017,"One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked.",No
8018,I believe that we should defend Formosa.,No
8019,We should come to its defense.,No
8020,"To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake.",No
8021,"Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun.",No
8022,It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.,No
8023,It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.,No
8024,"But with General Ridgway, Mr. Herter, General Collins, Admiral Spruance and many others, I think it's unwise to take the chance of being dragged into a war which may lead to a world war over two islands which are not strategically defensible, which are not, according to their testimony, essential to the defense of Formosa.",No
8025,I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.,No
8032,"I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well.",No
8034,"And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States.",Yes
8038,"Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant.",No
8039,It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.,No
8045,In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.,No
8055,"I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents.",No
8057,"The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed.",No
8058,"Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts.",No
8061,It's what we stand for.,No
8064,"I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, ""Vote for me because I'm a Democrat.""",No
8066,What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.,No
8067,Now that means the best leadership.,No
8068,"It may be Republican, it may be Democratic.",No
8070,The people have to make up their minds.,No
8071,"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did.""",No
8072,"I think the people should put America first, rather than party first.",No
8074,"All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward.",No
8078,"I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes.",No
8080,"Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man.",No
8082,The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.,No
8083,It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.,No
8084,"It has stood for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense, and as a result, produced Wilson, President Roosevelt, and President Truman.",No
8085,"The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon.",No
8087,They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.,No
8088,That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.,No
8089,"And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something.",Yes
8109,"In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half-slave or half-free.",No
8110,"In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery.",No
8111,"I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain.",No
8113,"Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself.",No
8114,The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.,No
8115,But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.,No
8116,"The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom.",No
8117,"If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world.",No
8118,"If we fail, then freedom fails.",No
8119,"Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?",No
8122,"I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making.",No
8125,I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.,Yes
8126,Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.,No
8127,"I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual.",Yes
8129,I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.,Yes
8130,"I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts.",No
8138,He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.,Yes
8140,He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.,Yes
8141,I think we can do better.,No
8143,I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.,No
8145,I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.,No
8146,And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.,No
8147,But I think there is also a national responsibility.,No
8148,The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.,No
8150,"A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so.",No
8151,"Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system.",Yes
8152,"I don't believe in big government, but I believe in effective governmental action.",No
8153,And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.,No
8154,It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.,No
8155,I think we can do a better job.,No
8156,I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.,No
8157,We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.,No
8158,"If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails.",No
8159,And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.,No
8160,The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.,No
8161,Because they felt that the American society was moving again.,No
8163,"I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists.",No
8166,I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.,No
8167,The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?,No
8169,And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.,No
8173,The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.,No
8174,There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.,No
8175,"There is no question but that this nation cannot stand still; because we are in a deadly competition, a competition not only with the men in the Kremlin, but the men in Peking.",No
8177,"But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead.",No
8178,"And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead.",No
8179,"Where, then, do we disagree?",No
8180,I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.,No
8181,"We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world.",Yes
8184,But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.,No
8187,"Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record.",No
8189,"Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?",No
8190,"Is it true that, as far as this country is concerned, in the field of electric power, in all of the fields that he has mentioned, we have not been moving ahead.",No
8191,"Well, we have a comparison that we can make.",No
8192,We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.,No
8193,"When we compare these two records in the areas that Senator Kennedy has - has discussed tonight, I think we find that America has been moving ahead.",No
8195,"We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years.",Yes
8197,We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.,Yes
8200,The same is true of highways.,Yes
8201,Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.,No
8202,We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.,Yes
8204,But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.,No
8205,What has happened to you?,No
8206,We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.,Yes
8208,We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.,Yes
8209,What's the net result of this?,No
8211,"Now, this is not standing still.",No
8212,"But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough.",No
8213,A record is never something to stand on.,No
8214,It's something to build on.,No
8215,"And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress.",No
8216,"And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way.",No
8219,"But on the other hand, when we look at the various programs that he offers, they do not seem to be new.",No
8221,"And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then.",No
8223,"We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people.",No
8224,"We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time.",No
8225,"Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims.",No
8226,We both want to help the old people.,No
8227,We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.,No
8230,"I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years.",No
8231,"Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending.",No
8232,I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.,No
8233,I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.,No
8236,"It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.",Yes
8237,"Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?",No
8240,It is a question of which administration does the right thing.,No
8241,"And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.",No
8242,"I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.",No
8244,Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.,No
8245,I know what it means to be poor.,No
8246,I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.,No
8247,"I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",No
8257,"Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?",No
8259,Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.,No
8260,He was nominated by it.,No
8261,"And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.",Yes
8262,I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.,No
8263,I hope he would grant me the same.,No
8264,The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?,No
8271,I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.,No
8279,"Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.",No
8280,"You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.",No
8285,"We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",Yes
8294,"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.",No
8295,The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.,No
8297,They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.,No
8299,They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.,No
8301,"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",No
8302,The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.,Yes
8305,So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.,No
8307,"The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.",Yes
8308,We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.,Yes
8309,I think that this farm policy has failed.,No
8313,I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.,No
8314,"And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.",No
8315,I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.,No
8317,I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.,No
8321,I think this is the wrong direction.,No
8322,I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.,No
8325,And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.,No
8327,"Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.",No
8328,"Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.",No
8329,"But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.",No
8338,"Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.",No
8340,"Now, I can only say this.",No
8347,Sometimes my advice has been taken.,No
8349,I do not say that I have made the decisions.,No
8350,"And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.",No
8352,"As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.",No
8358,I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.,No
8360,"Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.",No
8362,There's no certain road to the presidency.,No
8367,The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?,No
8374,"I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.",No
8375,"And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.",Yes
8381,Not reducing the interest -,No
8384,"In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.",No
8385,"What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.",No
8386,"Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.",No
8388,"The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.",Yes
8389,"The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.",Yes
8390,"Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.",No
8391,I think that's a good investment.,No
8393,"And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.",No
8397,And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.,No
8398,"Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.",Yes
8399,"Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.",No
8404,As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.,No
8406,"That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.",No
8409,"And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.",No
8410,"If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.",No
8412,I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.,No
8419,I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.,No
8420,"Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.",Yes
8421,"Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?",No
8425,We need higher teachers' salaries.,No
8427,"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.",No
8428,I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.,No
8429,There is another point that should be made.,No
8430,I favor higher salaries for teachers.,No
8433,"I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.",No
8434,Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.,Yes
8436,But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.,No
8438,"My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",No
8440,"When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.",Yes
8441,The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.,No
8444,"I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.",Yes
8446,"But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.",No
8449,"That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.",Yes
8450,That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.,No
8451,My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.,No
8456,Well as you take the bills -,No
8459,It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.,Yes
8463,"Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.",Yes
8464,It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.,Yes
8465,It was killed in the Rules Committee.,Yes
8466,And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.,Yes
8471,We offered an amendment to do so.,Yes
8472,"Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.",Yes
8473,And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.,Yes
8474,"In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.",No
8477,Well obviously my views are a little different.,No
8478,"First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.",No
8479,"I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.",Yes
8482,"When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.",No
8484,If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?,No
8485,The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.,No
8486,It was because they were too extreme.,No
8487,"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",No
8490,"I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.",No
8491,"Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.",No
8492,"We cannot, of course, control the Senate.",No
8493,"I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.",No
8494,Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.,No
8498,"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.",No
8499,You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.,No
8504,I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.,Yes
8506,"It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.",No
8507,"The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.",Yes
8508,"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.",Yes
8509,I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.,No
8516,I think it shows the difference between the two parties.,No
8517,One party is ready to move in these programs.,No
8522,"Well, I think they're serious.",No
8523,I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.,No
8524,We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.,No
8527,The major threat is external and will continue.,No
8529,I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.,No
8531,It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.,No
8534,It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.,No
8536,"And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.",No
8537,"And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.",No
8538,The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.,No
8545,Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.,No
8549,Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.,Yes
8550,"Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.",Yes
8555,"Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.",Yes
8557,And I think we have a powerful country.,No
8560,"It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.",No
8561,"I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.",No
8572,But the reason for that is obvious.,No
8573,They start from a much lower base.,No
8574,"Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.",Yes
8575,That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.,Yes
8576,"And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.",Yes
8577,Is this any reason for complacency?,No
8578,Not at all Because these are determined men.,No
8581,I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.,No
8582,Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.,No
8583,"I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.",No
8584,"I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.",No
8586,The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.,No
8587,"Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.",Yes
8589,But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.,No
8592,Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.,No
8593,The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.,Yes
8595,It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.,No
8599,The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.,Yes
8600,I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.,No
8602,"I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.",No
8606,I think it's a very clear contrast.,No
8607,"In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.",Yes
8610,"Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.",No
8611,The means are at question.,No
8613,"If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.",No
8616,"As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?",No
8619,"If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.",No
8620,"And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.",No
8622,"That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.",No
8624,"And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.",No
8661,"Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.",No
8662,The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.,No
8663,But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.,No
8667,"Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.",Yes
8669,I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.,No
8670,"And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.",Yes
8674,"fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.",No
8679,"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.",No
8681,"I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.",No
8684,You are robbing the American people of their savings.,No
8686,"Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.",No
8687,"But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.",No
8688,"I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.",Yes
8689,"conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.",No
8690,"We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.",Yes
8697,"And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30.",Yes
8698,"In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers.",Yes
8699,Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.,No
8700,"put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil.",No
8701,"Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments.",No
8702,their Social Security tax payments by 50%.,Yes
8703,"That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country.",No
8705,"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.",No
8709,Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?,No
8711,"And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he.",No
8713,"Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country.",Yes
8719,"Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it.",No
8720,"But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply.",No
8722,"The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used.",Yes
8723,But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.,No
8724,"And this is known oil reserves, known supplies.",No
8725,"There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago.",Yes
8726,"We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country.",Yes
8727,"I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production.",No
8728,"We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest.",No
8730,All of these things can be done.,No
8732,have leased only 2% of the possible.,Yes
8733,"possibility for oil of the continental shelf around the United States; when you stop to think that the government has taken over 100 million acres of land out of circulation in Alaska, alone, that is believed by geologists to contain much in the line of minerals and energy sources, then I think it is the Government, and the Government with its own restrictions and regulations, that is creating the energy crisis.",Yes
8739,"all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough.",No
8740,"I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people.",No
8741,"and that's simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did.",Yes
8742,"I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf.",No
8743,"But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile.",No
8744,We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.,No
8745,"We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling.",No
8746,"We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient.",No
8747,"I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country.",Yes
8748,"Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve.",No
8749,"According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today.",Yes
8750,"So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy.",No
8753,I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.,No
8755,"That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years.",Yes
8756,"As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that.",No
8757,"Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973.",Yes
8760,"But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found.",Yes
8762,"Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact.",No
8766,And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity.,No
8767,"It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies.",Yes
8768,"I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later.",No
8777,"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country.",No
8780,"Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 - this very month - that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9.",Yes
8782,public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews.,Yes
8783,"I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short.",Yes
8784,"But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living.",Yes
8786,"And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today.",No
8791,"But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended.",No
8795,"Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present.",No
8797,"As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees.",Yes
8798,"I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work.",No
8799,Recognize that we have a voluntary military.,No
8802,As an aid to enlistment.,No
8803,"we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I.",Yes
8805,"In 1977, we took that away from the military.",Yes
8806,That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.,Yes
8807,"So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them.",No
8809,"We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment.",No
8810,"Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people.",No
8817,I'll catch up with it later.,No
8821,"I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money.",No
8823,"or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars.",Yes
8826,I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.,Yes
8828,I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.,No
8832,He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.,No
8843,I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.,No
8844,I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.,No
8847,"for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority.",No
8849,"What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?",No
8851,I don't know of a city in America that doesn't have the kind of problems you're talking about.,No
8852,"But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?",No
8854,"But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia.",Yes
8855,Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?,No
8856,"But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed.",No
8860,Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.,No
8861,The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.,No
8863,"We've got thousands and thousands of homes owned by government boarded up, being vandalized, that have been taken in mortgage foreclosures.",Yes
8864,"What if we had a homestead act, and said to the people, for $1 we sell you this house.",No
8869,"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960.",Yes
8871,"Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits.",Yes
8874,"I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them.",Yes
8878,"That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities.",No
8879,"In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country.",No
8883,John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.,No
8885,It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.,No
8887,"if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted.",No
8888,"Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it.",No
8889,But the Federal Government doesn't make money.,No
8891,"And in my view, this is not the answer to the problem.",No
8893,"I stood there, and I met the people.",No
8896,"But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people.",No
8898,"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?",No
8899,It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.,Yes
8900,"We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth.",Yes
8903,And why have they lost their industry?,No
8915,We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.,Yes
8916,"Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%.",Yes
8917,"And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be.",Yes
8919,I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.,No
8920,"His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information.",Yes
8922,I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.,No
8927,"So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes.",No
8930,"But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending.",No
8936,"We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures.",No
8937,"And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated.",Yes
8942,"Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance.",No
8943,Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.,No
8946,"And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs.",Yes
8947,"Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world.",Yes
8950,"But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion.",Yes
8951,I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.,Yes
8952,"And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending.",Yes
8953,"And the funny thing was that California, which is normally above the national average in inflation and unemployment, for those six years for the first time, was below the national average in both inflation and unemployment.",Yes
8955,"We deliberately took figures that we, ourselves, believed were too conservative.",No
8956,"I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan.",No
8957,"But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget.",No
8958,We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.,No
8960,"Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor.",No
8962,"But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office.",Yes
8964,"more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government.",Yes
8965,"But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans.",Yes
8967,"In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military.",Yes
8968,And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.,No
8970,"Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures.",No
8976,It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.,Yes
8978,"And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years.",Yes
8979,"And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt.",Yes
8991,"Oh, I'm it's my question.",No
8992,"But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country.",No
8993,"Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival.",No
8997,That we're a nation under God.,No
8999,"I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California.",Yes
9001,"But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader.",No

9016,I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.,No
9018,"And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter.",Yes
9019,"But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong.",No
9020,"And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools.",Yes
9022,"But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite.",No
9025,"Now, I don't think that's a bad idea.",No
9026,I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.,No
9029,And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.,No
9031,I happen to believe it is.,No
9033,I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.,No
9034,"And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term.",No
9035,"And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual.",No
9040,And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.,No
9042,"That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible.",No

9072,I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.,No
9073,"If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?",No
9074,Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?,Yes
9075,Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?,No
9078,"And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980.",No
9080,"It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes.",No
9081,We've got to stop drifting.,No

9085,"If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant.",No
9088,"Those are some of the great issues - atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism - that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems.",No

12530,I think there're several reasons.,No
12531,"In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world.",No
12535,We learned from their mistakes.,No
12538,"But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world.",No
12541,Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?,No

12544,"And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender.",No
12546,"It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen.",No
12547,"That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area.",No
12548,"First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability.",Yes

12565,We must have a great goal.,No
12567,To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.,No

12570,"We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles.",No

12583,Nor is the question that all Americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign.,No
12584,The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?,No
12585,Is our relative strength growing?,No

12643,We didn't recognize them for two months; the American Ambassador didn't show up for nearly eight months.,Yes
12644,I believe that the world is changing fast.,No

12667,We want to be stronger.,No

12669,But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.,No
12679,Our policies are very different.,No
12680,I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.,No
12682,Now let's just see what this means.,No
12683,"We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.",Yes
12685,"Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.",No
12686,"But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.",No

12695,We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.,Yes
12697,We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.,No

12700,Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.,No
12703,"Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral.",No
12704,They have to include the other countries of Latin America.,No
12705,"The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe.",No
12707,"That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.",No
12709,"The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.",No
12710,"We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.",No
12711,His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.,No
12712,His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.,Yes
12720,"Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed.",No
12721,This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.,No

12729,Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.,No
12732,We will select the best man we can get.,No
12733,"But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.",No
12735,"Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.",No
12737,"If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.",No
12739,"I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.",Yes
12741,Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.,Yes
12742,"Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else.",No
12747,"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.",No
12748,"Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated.",No
12752,"Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?",Yes
12753,"Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.",No
12754,Well let me make one thing clear.,No
12757,And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.,No
12758,"Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.",No
12760,Let's look at the vote on Hungary.,No
12761,There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.,Yes
12762,Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.,No
12763,Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?,No
12766,"America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.",No
12768,I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.,No
12769,I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.,No
12770,"I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.",No
12772,Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.,No
12773,The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.,No
12774,"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen.",No
12775,I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.,No
12778,"And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.",No
12781,"And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.",No
12782,"Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.",No
12783,"Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.",Yes
12794,So one more effort should be made.,No
12795,I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.,No
12798,"If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.",No
12799,I hope we can succeed.,No
12800,"But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.",No
12801,I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.,No
12802,There may be testing in outer space.,No
12803,I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.,No
12805,The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.,No
12806,So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.,No
12807,If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.,No
12808,But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.,No
12810,"War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.",No
12811,We ought to make one last effort.,No
12814,"I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.",Yes
12816,I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.,No
12818,"I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.",No
12819,There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.,No
12821,I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.,No
12828,"Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.",No
12830,"By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.",No
12831,Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.,No
12833,"Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.",No
12834,But let's look at the other side of the coin.,No
12836,We do not help it.,No
12837,"We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.",No
12838,"I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.",No
12839,"And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.",No
12840,"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say.",No
12842,"I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.",No
12847,"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.",Yes
12849,"In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.",No
12850,The Soviet Union does understand strength.,No
12851,"We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.",No
12852,"If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.",No
12855,"I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.",No
12856,"I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.",No
12861,"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.",No
12866,"We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.",Yes
12868,I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.,No
12869,"Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.",No
12871,"No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.",No
12872,"If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.",No
12873,"Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.",No
12877,"But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.",No
12878,"Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.",No
12879,This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.,No
12882,And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.,No
12884,"And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.",No
12886,We can put the Communists on the defensive.,No
12888,"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.",No
12890,"And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.",Yes
12891,This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.,No
12892,In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.,No
12893,"Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.",No
12894,I would just like to s- add this one point.,No
12895,"If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.",No
12896,"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.",No
12897,"If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.",No
12903,I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.,No
12904,He says he supports the President's position.,Yes
12905,He says that he voted for the resolution.,Yes
12906,Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.,Yes
12907,"But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.",Yes
12909,He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.,No
12910,"Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.",No
12912,"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us.",No
12913,I support the President's position.,No
12915,"I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.",No
12916,And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.,No
12924,"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.",No
12925,"The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.",Yes
12926,"Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.",Yes
12927,The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.,Yes
12928,"I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.",Yes
12932,Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.,No
12937,"That's not the position you took, however.",No
12939,Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.,No
12940,You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.,Yes
12941,And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.,Yes
12950,"If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.",No
12951,"But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.",No
12952,"My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.",No
12953,Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.,Yes
12956,We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.,No
12958,"If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.",No
12960,"I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.",No
12962,Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.,No
12964,"If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?",No
12965,Why didn't we bring students over here?,No
12969,"It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.",Yes
12970,"And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.",No
12973,We can no longer afford to be second best.,No
12975,"I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again.",No
12976,I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.,No
12977,"I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.",No
12978,And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.,No
12979,Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.,No
12980,I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.,No
12983,"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.",No
12984,America is not standing still.,No
12986,"And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.",No
12988,We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.,Yes
12991,More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.,Yes
12993,We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.,Yes
12996,Let's get that straight right away.,No
12997,"Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.",No
13000,"We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.",No
13001,"We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.",No
13005,It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.,No
13006,It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.,No
13007,"Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.",No
13010,But let's look at it.,No
13011,There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.,Yes
13014,Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.,Yes
13018,Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?,No
13020,"What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.",No
13021,We're on the side of freedom.,No
13024,"Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.",Yes
13025,One other point I would make: what could you do?,No
13027,And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.,No
13028,"What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?",No
13029,"It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.",No
13030,"It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.",No
13031,"In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.",No
13032,"And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong.",No
13033,"See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.",No
13083,It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.,No
13084,And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.,No
13085,We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.,No
13090,"I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.",No
13091,I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.,No
13092,I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.,No
13094,I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.,No
13095,But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.,No
13098,"We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.",No
13099,"As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin.",No
13105,"Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack.",No
13106,"I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa.",Yes
13107,"But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States.",No
13109,This is the history of dealing with dictators.,No
13110,This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.,No
13114,Now what do the Chinese Communists want?,No
13116,"And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them.",No
13117,"It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?",No
13119,"And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace.",No
13124,"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.""",Yes
13125,"Now, that is the issue.",No
13126,I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.,No
13127,I support it and the Pescadores Island.,No
13128,That is the present American position.,No
13130,Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.,Yes
13131,"I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty.",No
13132,"Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa.",No
13133,"Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American.",Yes
13134,The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.,Yes
13135,They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.,Yes
13137,"This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where.",No
13143,"Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces.",No
13145,"It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately.",No
13146,"Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity.",No
13155,We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.,No
13156,It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.,No
13157,"But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels.",No
13159,"If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves.",No
13160,"But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war.",No
13164,"There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about.",No
13165,It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.,No
13168,"We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way.",No
13171,But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.,No
13172,There must be an absolute guarantee.,No
13173,"Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer.",No
13175,"And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands.",Yes
13184,"As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun.",Yes
13185,"Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again.",No
13188,"My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return.",No
13190,We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II.,No
13191,"We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again.",No
13192,"That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955.",Yes
13194,The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history.,No
13197,"And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace.",No
13202,That was done with much thought and deliberation.,No
13203,"Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area.",Yes
13204,I completely sustained the treaty.,Yes
13212,"To me that concept is completely repugnant.""",No
13215,"I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war.",No
13216,I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.,No
13225,They may - are not my style.,No
13226,"But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner.",No
13227,"Perhaps Mrs. Truman can, but I don't think I can.",No
13228,I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.,No
13229,If you'd pass that message on to him.,No
13232,"Of course, both er - Senator Kennedy and I have felt Mr. Truman's ire; and uh - consequently, I think he can speak with some feeling on this subject.",No
13233,"I just do want to say one thing, however.",No
13235,"But when a man's president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public.",No
13236,One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.,No
13240,"And I can only say that I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States.",No
13241,"And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: ""Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow.""",No
13247,"Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made.",No
13251,"Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there.",Yes
13252,"Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout.",Yes
13253,I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.,No
13254,"I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on.",No
13255,"I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here.",No
13256,"And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time.",No
13257,The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.,No
13259,What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.,No
13262,"For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free.",No
13273,"It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides.",No
13274,"Number three, the Vice President - on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight - indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth.",Yes
13281,Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.,Yes
13284,"And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself.",No
13293,"I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan.",No
13296,I would disagree with it.,No
13298,And that's my view now.,No
13299,I disapprove of the issue.,No
13300,I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.,No
13304,We can't settle for anything but the best.,No
13306,And that means that we can't have any test of religion.,No
13307,We can't have any test of race.,No
13308,It must be a test of a man.,No
13309,Also as far as religion is concerned.,No
13312,Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.,No
13313,We must not be divided on this issue.,No
13316,We cannot have it in our hearts.,No
13317,But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.,No
13321,"Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week.",No
13324,"Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point.",No
13325,"He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike.",Yes
13327,I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.,No
13328,"I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.",No
13330,One last point I should make.,No
13331,The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.,No
13333,"And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better.",No
13334,"Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management.",No
13335,We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.,No
13337,"Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they're stated by the Vice President.",No
13340,I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.,Yes
13341,I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.,No
13342,"I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.",No
13343,One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.,No
13347,He can set up a fact-finding committee.,No
13349,"He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.",No
13351,"But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.",No
13358,"Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.",Yes
13362,We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.,Yes
13363,"Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers.",Yes
13366,"Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire.",Yes
13368,"So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has.",No
13369,"But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention.",No
13374,"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't.""",No
13382,And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.,Yes
13383,Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?,No
13385,Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.,No
13386,"Well, what he is saying there in effect, we're going to have inflation.",No
13392,"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country.",No
13393,"I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly.",No
13394,"Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough.",Yes
13395,Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.,No
13397,"It's going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle.",No
13398,"Now, what do we do about it?",No
13399,"And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion.",No
13401,"In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth.",No
13402,"I refer, for example, to distressed areas.",No
13404,We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.,No
13405,"That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need.",No
13406,"And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth.",No
13407,"Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still.",No
13409,Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.,No
13410,He's been traveling in some other country.,No
13419,The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.,Yes
13421,But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.,No
13427,"And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added.",Yes
13428,This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.,Yes
13429,"And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more.",No
13431,The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.,Yes
13432,Many say four and a half per cent.,No
13434,That's why we don't have full employment today.,No
13442,I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.,No
13443,That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.,No
13446,Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.,No
13448,Particularly some of the smaller producers.,No
13449,They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.,Yes
13450,"But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully.",No
13452,"I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward.",No
13455,I favor the present depletion allowance.,No
13456,"I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich.",No
13457,Why do we have a depletion allowance?,No
13460,"Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator's.",No
13461,"And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them.",No
13466,"I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated.",Yes
13468,I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.,No
13476,"Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar.",No
13478,"Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports.",No
13480,This one must be stepped up.,No
13482,Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect.,No
13483,I think we have been right in carrying it.,No
13485,"But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we've aided in the Far East; these countries - some our former enemies, have now recovered completely.",Yes
13488,The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself.,No
13489,"We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about.",No
13493,"If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it.",No
13494,Now on the question of gold.,No
13495,"The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies.",No
13497,"We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade.",No
13498,We have to be able to compete in the world market.,No
13499,We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.,No
13501,"Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods.",Yes
13503,We have to be sure to maintain that.,No
13504,"We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own.",No
13508,"Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige.",No
13509,"And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom.",No
13511,There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.,No
13513,He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement.,Yes
13515,"Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours.",Yes
13516,Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.,Yes
13518,"Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily.",Yes
13520,"Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa.",Yes
13522,A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.,Yes
13526,"Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself.",Yes
13527,Laos is moving in that direction.,Yes
13528,So I would say our prestige is not so high.,No
13533,Let's look at the other side of the coin.,No
13539,"We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right.",No
13540,"And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.",No
13542,"In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically.",No
13543,"Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat.",No
13544,Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.,No
13592,"There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down.",Yes
13593,"The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up.",Yes
13595,"But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way.",No
13597,I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.,No
13600,"Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems.",No
13602,"On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration.",Yes
13603,I don't believe trickle down economics will work.,No
13606,I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.,No
13614,And what I don't like is trickle down government.,No
13616,"Government -- he says invest government, grow government.",No
13619,It's the private sector that creates jobs.,Yes
13623,I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.,No
13624,It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.,No
13625,But not by raising taxes.,No
13628,I do not want any more trickle down government.,No
13630,I want to do something about that.,No
13635,"If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding.",No
13636,And we are bleeding arterially.,No
13638,We have spent their money.,Yes
13640,"This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice.",No
13641,My plan balances the budget within 6 years.,Yes
13645,The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.,No
13657,His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.,Yes
13659,"And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief.",Yes
13660,He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.,Yes
13661,"And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent.",Yes
13664,"Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?",No
13668,But look what's happened to the middle class.,No
13670,The tax burden on them has not gone down.,Yes
13672,"I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector.",No
13674,That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.,No
13676,I think everybody's paying too much taxes.,No
13678,"Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it.",Yes
13679,And I said I make a mistake.,No
13681,That's quite different than some.,No
13682,But I think that's the American way.,No
13689,"And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people.",No
13693,"Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state.",Yes
13696,I'll give you an example.,No
13698,"Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average.",Yes
13701,And I'm going to do that.,No
13703,So we've got to do that.,No
13706,"Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is.",Yes
13708,"Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first.",Yes
13712,Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.,Yes
13713,"We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country.",Yes
13715,"We're low spending, low tax burden.",Yes
13719,I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.,No
13720,Let's put it in perspective.,No
13722,It's a fairly rural state.,No
13723,"It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined.",No
13729,"No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart.",No
13734,"Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant.",Yes
13735,"And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant.",No
13738,And the people who have jobs --,No
13747,"And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!""",No
13749,"What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people.",No
13752,"And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board.",No
13761,But I don't think it's fair.,No
13764,I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.,Yes
13769,"And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas.",Yes
13770,"And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment.",Yes
13772,"I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that.",Yes
13773,What was the other part of it?,No
13776,I don't think that's true at all.,No
13777,"I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it.",No
13779,"I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --",No
13781,"Well, no, but the point is that's a subjective thing.",No
13782,"See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?",No
13794,I will let the American people decide that.,No
13798,"The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress.",Yes
13799,"He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now.",Yes
13800,"I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy.",No
13801,Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.,No
13803,"They will be my first priority, not my election year concern.",No
13806,"But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress.",No
13807,You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.,No
13808,"Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%.",Yes
13812,"You know, remember the question, are you better off?",No
13822,And it's blocked by the Congress.,Yes
13831,I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.,Yes
13837,So the General Motors experience is relevant.,No
13839,I sold them my remaining shares.,No
13842,But let's take my life in perspective.,No
13844,"When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed.",Yes
13845,"And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years.",No
13850,"And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort.",No
13851,"Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded.",No
13852,And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.,No
13858,"I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too.",No
13862,"I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue.",No
13866,They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.,No
13867,"We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets.",No
13868,We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.,No
13869,So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.,No
13871,That's one of the things I want to change.,No
13878,That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.,No
13886,You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.,No
13890,Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.,No
13896,I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.,No
13897,And let me say this.,No
13898,"I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it.",No
13899,That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.,No
13900,"Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer.",No
13901,It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.,Yes

14326,"I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table.",No
14341,"If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up.",No

14368,So that's what I'll do as president.,No
14369,"I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do.",No
14381,"And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation.",No
14382,And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.,No
14385,They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on.,No
14387,And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.,Yes
14388,"So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them.",No
14390,"I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past.",No

14411,Nobody did any of this with evil intent.,No
14413,"Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream.",No
14418,But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.,No
14419,"In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.",Yes
14420,"All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel.",Yes
14421,Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.,Yes
14425,"Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.",No
14426,We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.,Yes
14429,"And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.",Yes
14430,"And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.",Yes
14432,And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.,No
14433,"And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.",No
14434,"Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.",Yes
14436,"And so I just have to say, it's fine.",No
14438,"Come on, that's not leadership.",No
14448,"The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.",Yes
14458,"Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.",No
14461,"But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.",No
14467,The whole problem came up in 1984.,Yes
14468,The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.,Yes
14471,I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.,No
14474,And they buried it till right after the election.,Yes
14475,"Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.",Yes
14476,"Now, if that's true, just tell me now.",No
14477,"I'm grownup, I can deal with it, I'll pay my share.",No
14478,But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.,No
14486,The debt and the deficit.,No
14488,"And if you watch it Thursday, Friday, Saturday this week, you'll get more.",No
14489,"A shameless plug there, Mr. President.",No
14490,But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.,No
14491,We have a government that doesn't work.,No
14492,"All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors.",No

14497,We've got to turn this thing around.,No
14500,But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.,No
14502,Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?,No
14503,"I don't have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants?",No
14507,"And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it.",No
14509,"You say, how can I get Congress to do that?",No
14510,"I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong.",No
14516,I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.,Yes
14517,"But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend.",Yes
14518,"Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging.",No

14544,And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?,No
14546,How about a line item veto?,No
14548,"And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending.",No
14552,"Well, that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage.",No
14564,"Now, I'll tell ya this.",No
14565,I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.,No
14566,"If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs.",No
14567,I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.,No
14568,"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country.",No
14569,"And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise.",Yes
14570,"So I think even he has learned that you can't say ""read my lips"" because you can't know what emergencies might come up.",No
14571,But I can tell you this.,No
14574,And you know how you can trust me about that?,No

14647,And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.,No
14654,So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.,No
14656,And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.,No

14733,"And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?",No
14738,"And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?",No
14739,"I need your support, I ask for your vote.",No
14740,And may God bless the US of America.,No
14745,"This Thursday night on ABC from 8:30 to 9, Friday night on NBC from 8 to 8:30, and Saturday night on CBS from 8 to 8:30, we'll be down in the trenches under the hood working on fixin' the old car to get it back on the road.",No
14747,"Absolutely we can win, because it's your country.",No
14750,"Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head.",No
14754,"The ""we"" is you and me.",No
14759,"Well, folks, we got one, and that one is a financial crisis.",Yes
14760,"Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?",No
14762,I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.,No
14763,Who's the best person to manage money?,No
14765,Who's the best person to get results and not talk?,No
14768,"And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?",No
14771,"To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you.",No
14809,"I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are.",No
14810,I do know what he has said about mine.,No
14811,"And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.",No
14812,"Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it.",No
14813,"Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us.",No
14814,And to maintain that peace requires strength.,No
14815,America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.,No
14818,I have seen four wars in my lifetime.,No
14820,"I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe.",No
14826,"spending - we can afford the tax cuts I have proposed and probably mainly because Mr. Carter's economic policy has built into the next five years, and on beyond that, a tax increase that will be taking $86 billion more out of the people's pockets than was taken this year.",No
14827,And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.,Yes
14829,"In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending.",No
14837,"And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process.",No
14839,I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.,No
14842,"The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased.",Yes
14843,"Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all.",Yes
14845,But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.,No
14846,"We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others.",No
14848,"This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past.",No
14850,"There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests.",No
14851,"That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves.",No
14859,"In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region.",No
14861,We have access to facilities in five different areas of that region.,Yes
14862,"And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world.",No
14867,"I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace.",Yes
14868,"I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut.",Yes
14869,"Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force.",Yes
14871,"Well, there are various elements of defense.",No
14872,"One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign.",No
14873,Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.,No
14876,"But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle.",No
14877,"Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand.",No
14887,Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.,No
14888,"In 1974, we had a so-called oil shock, wherein the price of OPEC oil was raised to an extraordinary degree.",Yes
14889,We had an even worse oil shock in 1979.,Yes
14891,The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.,Yes
14893,"Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase.",Yes
14894,It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.,Yes
14895,"In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%.",Yes
14896,"The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us.",Yes
14898,"which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate.",Yes
14900,"So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature.",No
14901,"So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead.",No
14910,"As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago.",Yes
14912,"At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved.",Yes
14913,"Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history.",Yes
14914,"The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years.",No
14915,"And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people.",Yes
14923,"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people.",No
14924,"When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said.",Yes
14929,"But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months.",Yes
14931,"And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%.",Yes
14934,We have inflation because the Government is living too well.,No
14936,I see my time is running out here.,No
14938,"Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in.",No
14939,And my economic plan calls for that.,No
14940,The President's economic plan calls for increasing the taxes to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way.,Yes
14941,But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.,No
14949,"most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform.",No
14950,I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.,No
14951,"As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it.",Yes
14952,We've had the Central Accounting.,Yes
14953,"Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that.",Yes
14954,"We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made.",No
14955,I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.,Yes
14956,And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.,Yes
14958,"Governor Reagan's proposal, the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, is one of the most highly inflationary ideas that ever has been presented to the American public.",No
14961,"One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage.",Yes
14962,"This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan.",No
14963,In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.,Yes
14970,"The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years.",Yes
14971,The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.,Yes
14972,"And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?",No
14979,"I have been talking to a number of Congressmen who have much the same idea that I have, and that is that in the inner city areas, that in cooperation with the local government and the national Government, and using tax incentives and with cooperating with the private sector, that we have development zones.",No
14980,"Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area.",No
14981,"And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas.",No
14983,"And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either.",No
14985,I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.,No
14986,You have to see it to believe it.,No
14989,And this was the spot at which President Carter had promised that he was going to bring in a vast program to rebuild this department.,Yes
15004,"I am eternally optimistic, and I happen to believe that we've made great progress from the days when I was young and when this country didn't even know it had a racial problem.",No
15006,"But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was.",No
15008,"And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people.",No
15018,This has been a very successful effort.,No
15020,"Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish.",Yes
15021,"We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit.",No
15022,"Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country.",Yes
15024,We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.,Yes
15026,It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.,No
15029,Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.,No
15030,"We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go.",No
15040,"In the past, those minority groups have often been excluded from participation in the affairs of government.",Yes
15041,"Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country.",Yes
15042,"I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans.",Yes
15046,"The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place.",No
15048,They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.,No
15053,"With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%.",Yes
15055,It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.,No
15058,"This, to me, is a very important difference between him and me in this election, and I believe the American people will judge accordingly.",No
15059,"There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends.",No
15069,"There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations.",Yes
15070,"Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons.",No
15072,"In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries.",Yes
15081,We will maintain our position of neutrality in the Iran and Iraq war.,No
15083,"When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released.",Yes
15092,I think you ought to have at least one answer to it.,No
15096,"And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?",No
15098,"I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?",No
15099,"First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing.",No
15101,"What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?",No
15102,And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.,No
15103,"In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home.",No
15109,"The degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice is total authoritarianism totalitarianism, I should say, in the alternative government, makes one wonder whether you are being helpful to the people.",No
15110,And we've been guilty of that.,No
15114,"And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place.",Yes
15117,I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.,Yes
15119,"Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives.",No
15120,"Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities.",No
15121,"And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace.",No
15126,"And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President.",No
15143,"I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy.",No
15145,The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.,Yes
15147,"But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done.",Yes
15150,It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.,Yes
15151,"Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States.",Yes
15153,And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.,No
15168,"He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors.",Yes
15169,The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.,No
15173,"But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing.",No
15175,"Yes, I'd like to respond very much.",No
15176,"First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time.",No
15177,"And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man.",Yes
15178,"Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty.",Yes
15180,I am not talking of scrapping.,No
15181,"I am talking of taking the treaty back, and going back into negotiations.",No
15182,"And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other.",No
15183,That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.,No
15186,Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.,No
15187,"He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union.",Yes
15188,"If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition.",No
15191,"It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican.",No
15193,"In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly.",No
15196,"I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying, with what I have said or what my positions are.",No
15199,"It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other.",No
15202,And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.,No
15208,Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.,Yes
15209,"If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation.",Yes
15210,That's one major war explosion in a warhead.,No
15211,"We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads.",Yes
15212,"The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach.",No
15218,"I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up.",No
15219,What I've had as a basic commitment since I've been President is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.,Yes
15220,"It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy.",No
15223,We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.,Yes
15224,"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy.",No
15225,We will drill more oil and gas wells this year than any year in history.,No
15227,We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.,Yes
15229,"This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect.",No
15235,"I'm not so sure that it means steadily higher fuel costs, but I do believe that this nation has been portrayed for too long a time to the people as being energy-poor when it is energy-rich.",No
15236,"The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now.",Yes
15237,The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.,Yes
15239,"With our modern technology, yes, we can burn our coal within the limits of the Clean Air Act.",Yes
15240,"I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that.",No
15241,"The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found.",Yes
15242,"Our Government has, in the last year or so, taken out of multiple use millions of acres of public lands that once were - well, they were public lands subject to multiple use - exploration for minerals and so forth.",Yes
15245,Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.,Yes
15246,And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.,No
15247,"But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe.",Yes
15251,"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country.",No
15253,We cannot cast aside these regulations.,No
15254,"We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce.",No
15255,"Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future.",Yes
15256,He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.,No
15258,"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position.",No
15260,The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.,Yes
15262,"And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth.",No
15267,"I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation.",Yes
15268,"And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were.",No
15271,"As a matter of fact,.",No
15276,"We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954.",Yes
15277,"So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can.",No
15280,"If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations.",Yes
15283,"As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil.",Yes
15284,"The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing.",No
15295,"What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check.",No
15296,"We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn.",No
15297,"They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis.",No
15298,"But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration.",No
15304,"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy.",No
15305,"Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it.",Yes
15306,"I noticed also in The Wall Street Journal early this week, that a preliminary report of his task force advocates making Social Security more sound by reducing the adjustment in Social Security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation.",Yes
15307,"These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age.",No
15308,"But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way.",No
15312,"Well, that just isn't true.",No
15314,"Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it.",No
15317,That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.,No
15320,"I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get.",No
15321,I'd like to change that.,No
15323,These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.,No
15325,"We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact.",No
15326,"In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits.",No
15327,"Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare.",Yes
15328,"Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it.",No
15329,"These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people.",No
15333,I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.,No
15336,There is something else about Social Security.,No
15339,"I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care.",Yes
15341,"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party.",No
15342,"The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation.",No
15343,These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.,No
15353,"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question.",No
15355,"This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others.",No
15356,"The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations.",No
15359,"Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past.",No
15364,I happen to believe that the Federal Government has usurped powers of autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level.,No
15365,"It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them.",No
15369,"Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something.",Yes
15372,"But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept.",No
15373,"And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today.",No
15374,"That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept.",No
15378,I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.,No
15382,"When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents.",Yes
15384,"That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party.",No
15389,"While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth.",Yes
15394,"Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system.",No
15402,"So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future.",No
15404,"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights.",No
15405,And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.,No
15407,"Those would all, could all be challenged by men.",No
15408,And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.,No
15410,"But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union.",Yes
15414,I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.,No
15415,"Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life.",No
15419,And I've had to deal with those crises as best I could.,No
15420,"As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us.",No
15423,I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.,No
15424,The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.,No
15425,We must have a society that's just and fair.,No
15428,"In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country.",No
15429,"I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts.",No
15430,"But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50.",No
15431,"And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office.",No
15432,"It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one.",No
15434,Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.,No
15435,And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.,No
15438,There is a partnership involved in our nation.,No
15440,I ask the American people to join me in this partnership.,No
15442,"Yes, I would like to add my words of thanks, too, to the ladies of the League of Women Voters for making these debates possible.",No
15447,"I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?",No
15448,Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?,No
15449,Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?,No
15451,"Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago?",No
15452,"And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for.",No
15453,"If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have.",No
15454,This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.,No
15455,"We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing.",No
15456,We talk about the unemployment lines.,No
15458,All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.,No
15459,"I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make.",Yes
15461,I know because we did it there.,No
15463,"We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people.",Yes
15466,"I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help.",No
15467,"And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great.",No
15484,"I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.",No
15487,But we have work to do in this nation.,No
15489,"And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war.",No
15490,"We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere.",No
15492,But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.,No
15493,And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.,No
15501,"You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it.",No
15502,And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.,No
15512,"And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life.",No
15516,He had two terms in the Congress.,No
15518,"He founded authored, the job training partnership act.",Yes
15520,"We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing.",No
15522,"If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty.",No
15528,And so I'm proud of my choice.,No
15529,"And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion.",No
15531,I made a good selection.,No
15532,"The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say.",No
15537,And that's why people are so concerned.,No
15538,Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.,No
15539,"More than that, it was the first national security decision that we had to make.",Yes
15556,I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.,No
15557,"More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.",Yes
15558,And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.,No
15560,And what I have proposed is something much better.,No
15563,I hear this talk about a blank check.,No
15567,"And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.",No
15569,So I'm pledged to do that.,No
15573,"Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.",No
15574,He's broken it three times in the past year already.,Yes
15575,So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.,No
15581,"No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending",No
15588,"No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.",No
15589,There is no way of anticipating what may happen.,No
15590,"I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.",No
15591,And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.,No
15593,That's not what we are going to do.,No
15599,But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.,No
15600,"And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.",No
15604,"I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.",No
15605,"(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful.",No
15606,And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.,Yes
15621,I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.,No
15625,"Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.",Yes
15627,"(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.",No
15628,I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.,No
15629,I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.,No
15630,"(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.",No
15631,But I'm also a serious guy.,No
15634,(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.,No
15636,"I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.",Yes
15637,"And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.",Yes
15642,"And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.",No
15644,I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.,No
15657,What was he referring to?,No
15660,"And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.",No
15662,"And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.",No
15665,Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.,No
15666,And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.,No
15668,"But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.",No
15669,"He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU.",No
15670,And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.,No
15671,Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left.,No
15673,"But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.",No
15683,And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.,No
15687,We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.,No
15688,And that's the kind of America I want.,No
15692,But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.,No
15703,"They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?",No
15705,"I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.",No
15706,"It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.",No
15709,"So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.",No
15712,We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.,Yes
15713,And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.,No
15716,"We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.",No
15721,"And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.",No
15723,"Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.",No
15725,Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.,No
15729,We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.,No
15732,We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces.,No
15733,But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.,No
15734,"I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.",No
15742,"Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.",Yes
15743,That's an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent.,No
15746,There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.,No
15747,And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won't address is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our economic security.,No
15748,How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?,No
15749,"And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.",No
15752,"We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.",No
15753,"And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.",No
15754,"And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.",No
15755,And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.,No
15757,I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.,No
15758,But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.,No
15760,And that's the kind of America I want to build.,No
15762,I think the foremost (Applause),No
15766,I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.,No
15768,"It takes eight years, ten years, to do that.",No
15772,"And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.",Yes
15773,And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.,Yes
15776,And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.,No
15784,"Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.",No
15785,But there are many people who I admire in this country today.,No
15786,"Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.",No
15788,I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive.,No
15791,"I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.",No
15793,"I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.",No
15797,Members of the clergy who have done the same.,No
15799,"I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.",No
15802,"In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.",No
15809,I agree with the Governor on athletics.,No
15811,I think of Dr. Fauci.,No
15812,Probably never heard of him.,No
15813,"You did, Ann heard of him.",No
15815,"But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States.",No
15816,He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.,Yes
15821,"say, he is our hero.",No
15831,"No, let me tell you something about that.",No
15832,And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.,No
15837,And we've got a strong family.,No
15839,"And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.",No
15841,"You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses.",No
15843,"And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.",No
15844,I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.,No
15845,Because it's gotten a little ugly out there.,No
15846,It's gotten a little nasty.,No
15847,It's not much fun sometimes.,No
15848,And I would cite again Dan Quayle.,No
15849,"I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed.",No
15852,But he's in the arena.,No
15855,So I salute these things.,No
15857,Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.,No
15858,He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage.,No
15860,"Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.",No
15863,I thank you for that.,No
15866,"And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings.",No
15870,I think you believe in them.,No
15871,They're not left or right.,No
15873,"I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.",No
15875,We may think that you deal with them in different ways.,No
15878,I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.,No
15882,I think the American people would appreciate that.,No
15890,"Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.",No
15893,"He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.",No
15894,We took the child to New York.,No
15895,"Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.",No
15896,"If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life.",No
15897,And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.,No
15898,"I think human life is very, very precious.",No
15899,"And, look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to meet.",No
15900,I know others disagree with it.,No
15904,"And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.",No
15908,"Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.",No
15909,"But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions.",No
15910,"It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?",No
15911,"(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",No
15912,"Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?",No
15913,"That's a decision that only a woman can make, after consulting her conscience and consulting her religious principles.",No
15923,"No, I don't happen to share that goal.",No
15924,"It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.",No
15925,"But I do think this, that the next president, even within a relatively stable budget and that's what we are going to have for the foreseeable future will have to make those tough choices that I was talking about and that Mr. Bush doesn't seem to want to make.",No
15928,"And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.",No
15929,So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.,No
15935,This is a big question.,No
15936,And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.,No
15940,"So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices.",No
15942,"But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.",No
15943,And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.,No
15944,The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification.,No
15945,"And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided",No
15953,"And some domestic programs as well, Andrea.",No
15961,"As a matter of reality, Fm going to have to because we have had not one but two detailed studies which indicate that there are billions and billions of dollars to be collected that are not being paid these are not taxes owed by average Americans.",Yes
15964,But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.,Yes
15968,"The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this.",No
15971,Republican governors as well as Democratic governors.,No
15975,"But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration.",No
15976,"But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that",Yes
15978,and that's where you begin.,No
15980,"Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of economists' support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept.",No
15983,I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.,No
15984,"I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world.",No
15986,And we are doing a better job of it.,No
15990,The American working man and woman are not taxed too little.,No
15991,The Federal Government continues to spend too much.,No
15997,More so you than me.,No
16005,"So, I don't want to fool around with it.",No
16007,It always works that way.,No
16009,In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.,No
16010,We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.,No
16011,And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.,No
16013,And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.,No
16016,"And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now.",No
16021,"George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system.",Yes
16027,"The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting.",No
16030,And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.,No
16031,Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.,No
16037,One I don't have a list yet.,No
16038,"I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident.",No
16040,"Secondly, I don't have any litmus test.",No
16041,"But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution.",No
16042,I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench.,No
16045,There is no litmus test on any issue.,No
16052,If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause),No
16053,that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November.,No
16055,And I think the Vice President supported the Bork nomination.,No
16057,"I've appointed over 130, so I have a record.",Yes
16059,And I'm very proud of it.,No
16060,I don't ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats.,No
16061,"I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders.",No
16064,And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.,No
16074,"Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?",No
16078,"Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.",No
16082,Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.,No
16088,"But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs.",Yes
16091,So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.,No
16094,And I have made some good sound proposals.,No
16095,"But again, we have a big difference on child care, for example.",No
16096,"You see, I want the families to have the choice.",No
16097,I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.,No
16098,"I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more.",No
16102,And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.,No
16109,That is absolutely not true.,No
16112,It had nothing to do with the debate on Social Security.,No
16115,"No, and I have to (Applause)",No
16121,"But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically.",No
16124,I want to move ahead.,No
16126,I'm interested in 240 million points of light.,No
16127,"I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country.",No
16128,"But as we look at the decisions that the next president of the United States is going to have to make, I just don't believe the place you go first is those programs, those so-called entitlements, which provide a basic floor of income and a modest amount of medical care for the elderly, the disabled, for people who can't make their way on their own, and in many cases, have given a great deal to this country.",No
16132,"It's something that we pay into now so that we will have a secure retirement, and our parents and grandparents will have a secure retirement.",No
16134,So that's not where we ought to go.,No
16135,There are plenty of places to cut.,No
16137,There are we certainly ought to be able to,No
16139,"Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that.",No

16143,"We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture.",No
16144,He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.,No
16149,"And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting.",No
16152,And we ought to expand our markets abroad.,No
16157,The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.,Yes
16168,"It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?",No
16173,But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.,No
16174,"We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water.",No
16175,"But the only way you can express your love for clean water is to double the appropriations for clean water, and then rant against the deficit.",No
16176,I am for clean water.,No
16177,I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.,No
16178,I've been to these national parks.,No
16180,"I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side.",No

16185,I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.,No
16188,"Can you add five seconds, Bernie, out of fairness?",No
16189,"Come on, give me five.",No
16190,"I mean, this guy, this is too much.",No
16191,But I'm not going to do that.,No
16195,"And I'll do a good job, because I am committed.",No
16198,"Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute.",No
16202,I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.,No
16203,"I'm also against the pipeline embargo, which you folks attempted to impose.",Yes
16208,"George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years.",Yes
16228,The American people are up to here with debates.,No
16232,I've spelled out my position.,No
16234,But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.,No
16241,"Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else.",No
16242,And so I don't know what the answer is.,No
16245,"So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out.",No
16247,There will be no more debates.,No
16250,"I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates.",No
16252,"Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues.",No
16253,"Yes, we have fundamental differences.",No
16254,I think a great many of them have come out today.,No
16255,"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away.",No
16261,I am concerned about what that does to our future.,No
16262,I'm concerned about the fact that so many of our securities are in the hands of foreign banks because of these massive deficits.,Yes
16268,"I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent.",No
16270,"And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well.",No
16271,"That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make.",No
16272,"But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions.",No
16278,"I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen.",No
16279,"We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us.",No
16282,Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.,No
16284,"In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union.",No
16287,"It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola.",No
16288,We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.,No
16289,"That wouldn't have stopped if we hadn't been willing wouldn't have even started, the Soviets coming out, if we hadn't even been willing to support the freedom fighters there.",No
16291,"Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country.",No
16296,"Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on.",No
16298,"An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons.",No
16304,Why are these plants being closed down?,No
16305,"I don't know what the latest cost estimates are, but it's going to be in the range of 25, 50, 75, $100 billion.",No
16306,"Now, somebody has to bear the responsibility for this.",No
16311,"That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe.",No
16312,Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?,No
16317,"I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced.",No
16322,and must do what he's talking about now.,No
16328,"Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too.",No
16331,"Because I think you see, I am one who I get kidded by being a little old fashioned on these things, but I do believe in public service.",No
16333,And I don't think anybody has a call on people in their Administrations going astray.,No
16336,"And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish.",No
16339,I will have an ethical office in the White House that will be under the President's personal concern.,No
16341,"I hope I will do a good job as one who has had a relatively clean record with no conflicts of interest in his own public life, as has the Governor, to exhort young people to get into public service.",No
16342,"But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me.",No
16343,"And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality.",No
16344,"But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that I've got a good record.",No
16345,"And there are more, if you want to talk about percentage appointments, more Members of Congress who have been under investigation percentage-wise that people in the executive branch.",Yes
16346,And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.,No
16347,His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.,No
16349,"Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative.",No
16350,Let's vow to work together to do something about it.,No
16353,"But here again, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to.",No
16362,I think that says a great deal to the American people about the standards we'll set and the quality of the people that we will pick to serve in our Administration.,No
16368,"28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles.",No
16369,I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.,No
16371,That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.,No
16377,"But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich.",Yes
16378,We can do better than that.,No
16379,"Not working with government alone, but all of us working together.",No
16380,"Lloyd Bentsen and I are optimists, and so are the American people.",No
16381,"And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future.",No

16385,"Thank you, and God bless you.",No
16389,"So let me repeat, I do have respect for my opponent, for his family, for the justifiable pride he takes in his heritage.",No
16390,But we have enormous differences.,No
16393,Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.,No
16395,"I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and that's why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals.",No
16396,That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.,No
16399,This election is about big things.,No
16400,And perhaps the biggest is world peace.,No
16401,And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.,No
16404,I want to build on that.,No
16405,"I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.",No
16407,"And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth.",No
16409,And I will be a good president.,No
16411,"Thank you very, very much.",No
16439,"This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project.",No
16440,"We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work.",No
16441,There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.,No
16442,"First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.",No
16443,"Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.",No
16446,Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.,No
16449,"There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other.",No
16450,In a > Transfer interrupted!,No
16451,"ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.",No
16454,"Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?",No
16455,Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.,Yes
16456,"And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.",No
16458,But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.,No
16461,I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.,Yes
16463,"It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.",Yes
16464,We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.,Yes
16466,We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.,No
16473,"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.",Yes
16476,"In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.",Yes
16479,"In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.",Yes
16482,And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.,Yes
16484,"And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.",No
16489,"I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.",No
16491,"I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.",Yes
16492,So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.,No
16494,It has some good provisions in it.,No
16496,"On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad.",No
16497,"And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval.",No
16500,The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it's just a welfare program for the rich.,No
16504,"In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.",Yes
16505,"The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations.",No
16506,"As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent.",Yes
16515,"Well, as a matter of fact there is.",No
16516,"If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.",Yes
16519,I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.,No
16529,And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.,No
16530,"Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs.",No
16532,The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.,No
16533,"And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change.",No
16535,"But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president.",No
16536,Keep my promises to the American people.,No
16541,It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.,No
16542,"But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.",Yes
16543,"And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.",Yes
16544,"And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief.",Yes
16545,"Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend.",Yes
16546,I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.,No
16553,The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.,Yes
16554,About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.,Yes
16555,We gave them ample time.,No
16556,I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.,No
16560,"It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems.",No
16563,The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.,Yes
16564,"So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.",No
16569,"I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship.",Yes
16570,I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.,No
16572,Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.,No
16574,There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.,No
16577,And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.,No
16578,I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.,Yes
16580,"We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.",No
16581,"And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.",No
16588,"When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.",Yes
16589,And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.,Yes
16591,We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.,No
16592,It hasn't been undone since I was there.,No
16595,"When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.",No
16596,We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.,No
16599,This needs to be changed.,No
16602,"For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.",Yes
16603,Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.,No
16604,The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.,No
16606,This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.,No
16608,Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.,Yes
16609,"We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.",Yes
16610,"This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.",No
16613,I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.,No
16616,"Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.",Yes
16617,But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.,Yes
16619,We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.,Yes
16621,The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.,No
16622,I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.,Yes
16623,"For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.",Yes
16624,"In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.",Yes
16625,"But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.",No
16627,"If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.",No
16628,There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.,No
16629,There's no way to get the answer to a question.,No
16630,"When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.",Yes
16632,This is the kind of change that would be made.,No
16633,"And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.",No
16635,"I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.",Yes
16638,Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.,Yes
16639,And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.,Yes
16641,"We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.",Yes
16642,"So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.",No
16651,"We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.",Yes
16652,"But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.",Yes
16653,The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.,No
16654,And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.,No
16655,We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.,No
16657,We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.,Yes
16659,"We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.",No
16664,It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.,Yes
16665,At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.,Yes
16666,I don't know where that money would come from.,No
16667,"But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.",No
16670,"We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.",No
16671,"As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.",Yes
16675,"Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.",No
16677,We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.,Yes
16679,"We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.",No
16685,The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.,No
16686,Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.,Yes
16687,"We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.",Yes
16689,He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.,Yes
16690,"This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.",Yes
16691,"We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.",Yes
16693,This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.,No
16700,I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.,No
16702,I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.,Yes
16704,"Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day.",Yes
16706,We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.,No
16709,We're gonna run out of oil.,No
16710,When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.,Yes
16712,We now import about 44 percent of our oil.,Yes
16715,We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.,No
16716,"And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.",No
16717,I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.,No
16718,We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.,No
16719,"But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.",No
16723,"These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.",No
16725,That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.,No
16728,Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.,No
16731,"We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.",No
16732,"And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.",Yes
16735,Uh - this would - would help a great deal.,No
16736,So mandatory conservation measures - yes.,No
16737,Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.,No
16738,And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.,No
16740,"And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.",Yes
16741,"These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.",No
16743,Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.,No
16747,If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.,No
16749,"In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.",No
16750,In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.,No
16751,"In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.",Yes
16753,"In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.",Yes
16761,Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.,Yes
16763,Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.,No
16764,"In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.",Yes
16766,The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.,No
16770,"We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.",Yes
16772,Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.,No
16773,"And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.",No
16774,"I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.",No
16778,"Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.",Yes
16780,"These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.",No
16781,I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.,Yes
16783,"As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.",Yes
16784,"And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.",Yes
16791,"I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.",No
16793,About a thousand raised their hands.,Yes
16794,Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.,Yes
16795,And still he talks about - uh success.,No
16797,He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.,No
16799,"We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.",Yes
16800,"And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.",Yes
16801,"This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.",No
16802,He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.,Yes
16803,There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.,Yes
16804,"And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.",Yes
16807,It shows a lack of leadership.,No
16809,Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.,Yes
16811,"One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.",Yes
16821,"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.",Yes
16823,"Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.",Yes
16825,A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.,Yes
16826,"When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them.",No
16827,"Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.",No
16829,"This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.",Yes
16830,This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.,Yes
16831,"And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em.",No
16832,"Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.",No
16833,"The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can.",No
16835,"Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies.",No
16836,They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.,Yes
16839,You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.,No
16843,"You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion.",Yes
16844,Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.,Yes
16848,"No, I wouldn't do away with all - uh business deductions.",No
16849,I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.,No
16850,"But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone.",No
16852,"What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes.",No
16854,"These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.",Yes
16855,It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.,No
16859,"Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country.",Yes
16860,I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.,No
16862,"I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption.",No
16864,"Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes.",No
16865,The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.,Yes
16866,"President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year.",Yes
16867,"I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year.",Yes
16868,My average in two years is twenty-six.,Yes
16881,There is a considerable anti-Washington feeling throughout the country.,No
16885,"For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like.",No
16886,It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.,No
16887,I don't think the American people are getting their money's worth from the majority party that run this Congress.,No
16888,"We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society.",Yes
16890,And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.,No
16891,"So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress.",No
16892,They spend too much money on themselves.,No
16893,They have too many employees.,No
16894,There's some question about their morality.,No
16895,"It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator.",No
16903,"So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress.",No
16904,"But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might.",No
16905,Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.,No
16906,"He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government.",No
16907,I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.,No
16910,"I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress.",No
16913,It's a matter of leadership or no leadership.,No
16917,"Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress.",Yes
16918,I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.,Yes
16919,This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.,No
16920,"This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country.",No
16923,"That, I think, is a good balance.",No
16926,"And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run.",No
16944,I would have uh - done it opposite.,No
16945,"I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison.",No
16947,I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.,No
16948,"But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto.",No
16950,The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.,No
16951,"Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations.",No
16952,As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.,No
16953,Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.,Yes
16954,They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh - fiscal policy of the uh - executive and legislative branches of the government.,No
16955,It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.,No
16956,It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.,No
16963,"You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others.",Yes
16965,Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.,No
16966,It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.,No
16984,There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.,No
16990,It's a time for unity.,No
16992,"It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate.",No
16993,And it's a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people.,No
16994,"For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to.",No
16995,This is uh - not compatible with the purpose of our nation.,No
16997,It needs to be competent.,No
16998,"The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart.",No
16999,We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.,No
17001,We've got a government of stalemate.,No
17002,We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.,No
17004,It's not the America that we have to have in the future.,No
17005,I don't claim to know all the answers.,No
17006,But I've got confidence in my country.,No
17007,Our economic strength is still there.,No
17008,"Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth.",No
17009,"And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore.",No
17010,We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.,No
17011,I owe the special interests nothing.,No
17014,I believe that we can work together.,No
17015,"And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth.",No

17032,Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.,No
17033,In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.,No
17035,We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.,No
17036,The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.,No
17037,The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.,No

17087,I have a plan -- not a secret plan.,No
17091,"So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy.",No
17093,"Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates.",Yes
17094,"Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery.",No
17095,We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.,Yes
17096,"The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further.",Yes
17097,"In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military.",Yes
17098,"So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet.",Yes
17099,"And when they meet, that is a balanced budget.",No
17108,"But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent.",Yes
17117,One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.,No
17118,And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.,No
17120,"But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars.",Yes
17122,We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.,Yes
17123,It was $200 billion deficit instead.,Yes
17124,And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we'll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery.,No
17125,"Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit.",Yes

17155,I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.,No
17157,"Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits.",Yes
17158,"And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.",Yes

17199,"And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.",Yes
17201,"First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.",No

17210,I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?,No
17211,"And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.",No
17212,"Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",Yes
17216,Our policy was not to cut subsidies.,No

17225,"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''",No
17226,[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.,Yes
17228,"And when the President was asked the other day, ""What do you want to cut in the budget?",No
17230,That's Social Security and Medicare.,No
17232,"So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.",No

17238,Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.,Yes
17241,"And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.",No
17242,"And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.",Yes
17245,"And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.",Yes
17250,"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term.",No
17251,"But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.",No
17253,And I do resort to prayer.,No
17254,"At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.",No
17255,"As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.",No
17256,"So, it does play a part in my life.",No
17257,I have no hesitancy in saying so.,No
17258,"And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",No
17260,The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.,No
17261,"I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.",No
17265,We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.,No
17267,"And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.",No
17272,"First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.",No

17278,"Whether that helps or not, I don't know.",No
17279,I have a deep religious faith.,No
17282,It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.,No
17284,And I think we're all together on that.,No
17285,"What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.",No
17286,All history tells us that that's a mistake.,No
17289,That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.,No
17290,"And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",No
17304,"A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.",No
17306,It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.,No
17309,"Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.",No
17310,"I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.",No
17313,A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.,No
17314,"These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.",No
17315,"With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.",No
17317,I'll stand on my record on that.,No
17318,"And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.",No
17322,And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.,Yes
17323,Let's take the example that the President cites.,No
17326,We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.,No
17327,But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?,No
17328,Who would write the prayer?,No
17330,How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?,No
17347,My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.,No
17350,They don't want this arms race.,No
17351,And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.,No
17352,And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.,No
17353,"The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down.",No
17354,"And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.",No
17355,"They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.",Yes
17357,The American people want this environment protected.,No
17358,"They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.",Yes
17359,The American people want their children educated.,No
17360,"They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.",No
17362,They want those civil rights laws enforced.,No
17363,They want the equal rights amendment ratified.,No
17364,They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.,No
17365,"And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.",No
17366,"I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.",No
17368,"Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.",No
17369,The President says it'll disappear automatically.,No
17371,I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.,No
17373,"The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.",Yes
17374,"As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",No
17377,"Well, again, I'm running on the record.",No
17378,I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.,No
17379,But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.,No
17382,"And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.",Yes
17384,"We have, to one-third of what it was.",Yes
17386,"We did, 25 percent across the board.",Yes
17390,"I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.",No
17393,And I think this is something the American people see.,No
17394,I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.,Yes
17395,"And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.",Yes
17396,We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.,Yes
17397,All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.,Yes
17398,"So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.",No
17402,"Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had.",Yes
17403,"I think that we've had something to do with that, just as we have with the drug problem nationwide.",No
17405,"Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.",No
17407,And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.,No
17408,"We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.",Yes
17409,"I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.",No
17417,"And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.",No
17421,"And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.",No
17422,That's where government should not be.,No
17424,"Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.",No
17425,"And so, my change had come earlier than that.",No
17427,I found that was rather difficult to do.,No
17428,But I finally did it.,No
17430,Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.,No
17432,"The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.",Yes
17446,"Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.",No
17447,"But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government.",No
17448,"With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution.",No
17449,"I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us.",No
17450,"And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.",No
17451,"And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.",Yes
17452,"We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.",No
17453,"Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.",No
17454,"In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.",Yes
17466,"So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this.",No
17468,And no one has approached it from that matter.,No
17470,I know that some churches do.,No
17471,"Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life.",No
17473,"And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own.",No
17477,"I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people.",No
17478,The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.,Yes
17480,"I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law.",No
17481,Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.,No
17482,The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.,No
17483,"I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different.",No
17489,But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?,No
17490,Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?,No
17491,"I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction.",No
17492,"In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives.",No
17493,We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.,No
17496,"One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union.",Yes
17503,"And it's a personal and private, moral judgment.",No
17504,I don't know the answer to when life begins.,No
17505,"And it's not that simple, either.",No
17507,"And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?",No
17509,Does every woman in America have to present herself before some judge picked by Jerry Falwell to clear her personal judgment?,No
17518,"Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?",No
17521,I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.,No
17522,"That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life.",No
17524,There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.,Yes
17529,And I don't agree with it.,No
17531,The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.,No
17532,"Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it.",Yes
17533,"And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent.",Yes
17535,I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.,Yes
17536,I'm opposed to these policies as well.,No
17551,"Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up.",Yes
17553,What does this mean in real life?,No
17555,"He's one of the wealthiest Americans, and he's our Vice President.",Yes
17556,In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.,Yes
17558,That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.,Yes
17559,I believe we need some fairness.,No
17560,And that's why I've proposed what I think is a fair and a responsible proposal that helps protect these people who've already got no relief or actually got a tax increase.,No
17565,"Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes.",No
17570,"As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing.",No
17571,I don't think we can do that for a few years.,No
17572,"But at some point, we want to do that as well.",No
17575,"You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it.",No
17577,[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.,No
17579,"I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes.",Yes
17581,And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.,Yes
17582,"And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down.",Yes
17584,"Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest.",No
17587,"At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax.",Yes
17588,"Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security.",Yes
17589,"And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money.",Yes
17590,"Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way.",No
17591,"The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed.",No
17593,"Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also.",Yes
17594,"But if you take it in percentages, then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board.",No
17598,"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me.",No
17600,"I don't foresee those things happening, so I say with great confidence I'm not going to go for a tax.",No
17601,"With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust.",No
17602,"All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him.",Yes
17606,"I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans.",Yes
17608,"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?",No
17615,You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.,Yes
17617,"[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?",Yes
17626,"And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem.",Yes
17627,And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.,Yes
17630,I gave you back some of that time.,No
17643,"Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up.",No
17644,"Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here.",Yes
17645,"It has begun to decline, but it is still going up.",Yes
17651,"We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them.",Yes
17653,We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.,Yes
17656,"But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans.",Yes
17657,We didn't think that was right.,No
17659,"So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have.",Yes
17668,"I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject.",No
17669,"I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America.",No
17670,And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.,No
17672,"I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes.",No
17674,"We're not going to rest and not going to be happy until every person in this country who wants a job can have one, until the recovery is complete across the country.",No
17678,"Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed.",No
17679,"Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program.",No
17680,"I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others.",No
17682,"If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs.",No
17683,The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.,No
17685,There is no question that the poor are worse off.,No
17687,But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.,Yes
17689,"Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting.",No
17690,One final point if I might.,No
17691,"There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.",No
17693,That's another reason to get the deficit down.,No
17696,I think they stand for civil rights.,No
17697,"I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support.",No
17698,They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.,No
17699,I think the business community wants to get involved.,No
17700,I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.,No
17701,I think that's part of it.,No
17702,I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.,No
17703,"I'm opposed to that, too.",No
17708,"There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure.",Yes
17712,The interest rates are based on inflation.,No
17714,"I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again.",No
17715,"Well, it isn't going to go back up.",No
17716,We're going to see that it doesn't.,No
17717,And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.,No
17719,"Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates.",No
17720,"I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on.",No
17722,"But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today.",Yes
17724,"Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that.",No
17727,That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.,No
17728,It's causing high interest rates.,No
17730,It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.,Yes
17743,Do you want to give me some suggestions?,No
17744,[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.,No
17745,I'm going to give the President some credit.,No
17746,"I think the President has done some things to raise the sense of spirit, morale, good feeling in this country, and he's entitled to credit for that.",No
17748,"I think in education, when he lectured the country about the importance of discipline, I didn't like it at first, but I think it helped a little bit.",No
17751,"And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign.",No
17756,"Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic.",No
17758,"I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right.",No
17759,"Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit.",Yes
17763,And give us a plan.,No
17765,Whose taxes will you raise?,No
17767,Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?,No
17768,"If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan.",No
17769,And that's the way it should be.,No
17770,The American people would be in charge.,No
17772,"Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me.",No
17774,And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.,No
17775,"And why I think it is outrageous -- first of all, it isn't true.",No
17776,"But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn.",No
17777,"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?",No
17778,Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?'',No
17779,And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.,No
17780,"Now, to -- I still -- I just have a minute here?",No
17786,"Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all.",No
17787,I told you never would I do such a thing.,No
17788,"But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.",Yes
17790,"If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit.",Yes
17792,"So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.",No
17797,"As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry.",No
17798,"But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic.",Yes
17800,"Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment.",Yes
17802,"Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here.",Yes
17803,"That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it.",No
17804,And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.,No
17805,That's why I want another 4 years.,No
17808,And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.,No
17809,"[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time.",No
17812,In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.,Yes
17813,This administration seems to run that every morning.,No
17814,And the result is exactly what we see.,No
17815,This economy is starting to run downhill.,No
17817,"Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982.",Yes
17818,Growth is a little over 3 percent now.,Yes
17819,Many people are predicting a recession.,No
17820,And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.,No
17821,"We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment.",No
17830,"No, I might as well just go with -- --",No
17842,"Well, we'll include it in that.",No
17844,"Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question.",No
17847,"Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again.",No
17848,"I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago.",No
17849,"The question, I think, should be enlarged.",No
17851,"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''",No
17852,I promised a new beginning.,No
17854,"If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job.",No
17857,Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.,Yes
17859,"Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years.",Yes
17860,"In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty.",Yes
17861,By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.,Yes
17863,"With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949.",Yes
17867,"Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget.",Yes
17870,Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.,Yes
17871,We have 543 at present.,Yes
17872,"We have -- our military, the morale is high.",No
17874,"And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons.",No
17875,"But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons.",No
17878,I think we've given the American people back their spirit.,No
17882,I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening's debate.,No
17885,The President's favorite question is: Are you better off?,No
17886,"Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off.",No
17887,"If you're middle income, you're about where you were.",No
17889,That's what the economists tell us.,No
17890,But is that really the question that should be asked?,No
17891,Isn't the real question is will we be better off?,No
17892,Will our children be better off?,No
17894,"I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership.",No
17896,Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?,No
17900,"Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?",No
17902,I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.,No
17904,"When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about.",Yes
17905,"America is a fair society, and it is not right that Vice President Bush pays less in taxes than the janitor who helps him.",Yes
17906,I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.,No
17907,I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.,No
17908,"And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful.",No
17909,"These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price.",No
17910,That's not fair for our future.,No
17911,"I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time.",No
17912,I believe in opening doors.,No
17916,The question is our future.,No
17917,"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''",No
17963,Our hearts go out to you.,No
17965,I can make American safer than President Bush has made us.,No
17966,And I believe President Bush and I both love our country equally.,No
17967,But we just have a different set of convictions about how you make America safe.,No
17968,I believe America is safest and strongest when we are leading the world and we are leading strong alliances.,No
17975,I know I can do a better job in Iraq.,No
17976,"I have a plan to have a summit with all of the allies, something this president has not yet achieved, not yet been able to do to bring people to the table.",Yes
17977,"We can do a better job of training the Iraqi forces to defend themselves, and I know that we can do a better job of preparing for elections.",No
17980,"I, too, thank the University of Miami, and say our prayers are with the good people of this state, who've suffered a lot.",No
17983,We pursued Al Qaida wherever Al Qaida tries to hide.,No
18010,And that's what they are.,No
18015,And that's what people are seeing now is happening in Afghanistan.,No
18020,"In Iraq, no doubt about it, it's tough.",No
18027,"They showed up in Afghanistan when they were there, because they tried to beat us and they didn't.",No
18030,"And if we lose our will, we lose.",No
18052,"And it wasn't until former Secretary of State Jim Baker and General Scowcroft and others pushed publicly and said you've got to go to the U.N., that the president finally changed his mind -- his campaign has a word for that -- and went to the United Nations.",Yes
18054,We had Saddam Hussein trapped.,No

18091,The world is safer without Saddam Hussein.,No
18096,"As a matter of fact, this is a global effort.",Yes
18099,"That's why it's essential that we make sure that we keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of people like Al Qaida, which we are.",No
18103,Seventy-five percent of his people have been brought to justice.,Yes
18125,"And when Iraq if free, America will be more secure.",No
18128,Iraq was not even close to the center of the war on terror before the president invaded it.,Yes
18131,"Now, that is not the judgment that a president of the United States ought to make.",No
18138,And you go visit some of those kids in the hospitals today who were maimed because they don't have the armament.,No
18140,But it's getting worse by the day.,No

18177,That's why they had to close down the subway in New York when the Republican Convention was there.,Yes
18186,"The president also unfortunately gave in to the chemical industry, which didn't want to do some of the things necessary to strengthen our chemical plant exposure.",Yes
18187,And there's an enormous undone job to protect the loose nuclear materials in the world that are able to get to terrorists.,No
18190,I'm going to do it in four years.,No

18234,I believe they want to.,No
18235,Prime Minister Allawi believes they want to.,No
18236,"And so the best indication about when we can bring our troops home -- which I really want to do, but I don't want to do so for the sake of bringing them home; I want to do so because we've achieved an objective -- is to see the Iraqis perform and to see the Iraqis step up and take responsibility.",No

18448,"And I believe that a fresh start, new credibility, a president who can understand what we have to do to reach out to the Muslim world to make it clear that this is not, you know -- Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq in order to go out to people and say that America has declared war on Islam.",No
18451,We need to deny them the safe havens.,No
18457,Osama bin Laden isn't going to determine how we defend ourselves.,No

18552,Soldiers know over there that this isn't being done right yet.,No
18560,I didn't say I would bring troops out in six months.,Yes
18562,And I think a critical component of success in Iraq is being able to convince the Iraqis and the Arab world that the United States doesn't have long-term designs on it.,No
18563,"As I understand it, we're building some 14 military bases there now, and some people say they've got a rather permanent concept to them.",Yes

19287,We'd like to have your support.,No
19289,"Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program.",Yes

19335,And I will address you as Mr. President.,No
19340,"Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.",Yes
19344,So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.,No
19345,I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.,No

19369,All 50 states did it.,Yes
19374,It seems to me that you have a selective memory.,No
19376,So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.,No
19378,But let me respond to what you said.,No
19380,That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.,No
19381,"So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested -- a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission.",No
19382,"And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met.",Yes
19383,"And then Senator Dole's ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who's out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal.",Yes
19387,"So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have.",Yes
19390,"Well, on campaign reform itself, we're going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission, take it out of politics.",No

19414,"Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you.",No
19416,I think we all do.,No
19418,I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.,No
19419,"I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn't dangerous and won't kill them and won't destroy their lives, get the message and change.",No
19424,But it seems to me the record is clear.,No
19425,"The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor.",Yes
19428,But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.,Yes
19431,"And in my administration, we're going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border.",No
19432,This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world.,No
19433,And we have a responsibility.,No
19434,You had a surgeon -- or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs.,Yes
19437,"But it seems to me the kids ought to -- if they've started, they ought to stop and just don't do it.",No
19439,"Let me say again, we did have a drug czar in Arkansas, but he answered to the governor, just like this one answers to the President.",Yes
19440,That's what I thought we ought to do.,No
19442,And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.,Yes
19443,I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.,No
19450,Not if I didn't have a better idea.,No
19451,But I've got a better idea.,No
19456,You don't buy any gun.,No

19492,"Well, the President doesn't have it quite right.",No
19493,"I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective.",No
19496,You're not going to worry about it anymore.,No
19499,"Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President.",No
19500,Talking about this and this.,No
19501,"You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals.",No
19503,"So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals.",No
19507,Look at where we are today.,No
19508,The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.,No

19665,"Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.",No

21328,"But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here.",No

21334,I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.,No
21335,"And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection.",No
21339,The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.,No
21341,So what is the answer?,No
21342,Let me just mention three things very quickly.,No
21343,"Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.",No

21349,So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.,No

21361,I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.,No
21363,"Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.",Yes
21364,"So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.",No
21365,"I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.",Yes
21366,If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.,No
21367,"But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.",No
21369,You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.,No

21377,I don't believe that's the way to do it.,No
21378,Here's some thing that'll help.,No
21379,Give us a balanced budget amendment.,No
21382,I'd like the government to have that.,No
21383,"And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.",No
21384,"I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.",Yes
21389,It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.,No

21392,You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.,No
21393,"I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.",No
21394,"So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.",No
21395,That's the main growing thing in the budget.,No
21396,"The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.",No

21401,"We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.",Yes
21402,"Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.",No
21406,But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.,Yes
21407,"Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.",No

21417,And what's happened in the meantime?,No
21424,Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this.,No
21427,"We'll deal with our problems, we'll solve our problems.",No

21444,"And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one.",No
21445,"We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC.",No

21448,"-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more.",No
21454,"Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.",No
21455,I think you have to look at it.,No
21456,I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.,No
21457,"In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.",Yes

21463,But character is an important part of the equation.,No
21464,The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.,No
21465,You did -- suffered through that?,No
21468,"I remember something my dad told me -- I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother -- which I faithfully did; he said serve your country -- my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth.",No
21469,"And I've tried to do that in public life, all through it.",No
21471,"My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus is -- I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war.",No

21474,That's what I feel passionately about.,No
21476,How would he feel about it?,No

21484,I don't want to --,No
21486,I don't want to --,No
21488,I get wound up because I feel strongly --,No

21497,"When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true.",No
21498,He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.,Yes

21507,I'm not interested in his character.,No
21508,I want to change the character of the presidency.,No
21509,And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.,No

21543,That's not specific in terms of a program.,No

21559,"I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness.",No

21593,"And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.",No
21594,"Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.",No
21596,We hear all the negatives.,No
21597,When you're president you expect this.,No

21620,If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.,No
21625,This is not mud slinging.,No
21626,This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.,No
21627,"This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country.",No

21635,"There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs.",Yes
21637,"They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind.",No
21639,"But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.",Yes
21641,We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.,No
21644,First you've got to have money to pay for these things.,No

21651,The president can't order Congress around.,No
21653,"That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?",No

21657,"The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.",No
21659,That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.,No
21660,The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.,No
21661,These people are hurting in the inner cities.,No
21662,"We're shipping the quote, ""low paying jobs"" overseas.",No

21677,You want jobs in the inner city?,No
21678,Do you want jobs in the inner city?,No
21683,"And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.",No
21684,And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.,No
21685,That's the way I would do it.,No
21686,"I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.",No
21695,"I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.",No

21698,"Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.",No
21699,I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.,No
21700,We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.,No

21703,"I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.",No

21706,In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.,Yes

21746,"Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.",No
21747,"And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.",No
21748,"And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.",No

21765,"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.",No
21766,And how to get them passed?,No
21767,Send us some people that will pass the idea.,No
21768,And I think you will.,No
21769,I think the American people want it now.,No
21770,"Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.",No
21774,"I know they're popular, but I'm against them.",No
21776,"I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.",No
21777,"Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.",No
21778,"I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise.",No
21779,"Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.",No
21781,"Now, let me tell you what I favor instead.",No
21782,"I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.",No
21784,"So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.",No

21794,"If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.",No
21796,So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.,No
21797,"And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.",No
21798,"They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.",No
21805,So let me try to answer you in this way.,No
21806,Let's start with a premise.,No
21807,"We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.",Yes
21809,A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.,Yes
21810,"So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.",No
21812,"So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.",No
21813,"Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed.",No
21814,"Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.",No
21816,I think you have to take on medical fraud.,No
21821,"To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.",No
21823,"Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.",No
21824,"They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.",Yes

21834,I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.,No
21836,"She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.",No
21838,One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.,No
21840,"It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.",Yes
21841,Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.,No
21842,"People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.",No
21843,So you can't blame the practitioners for the health problem.,No
21845,"Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.",No
21846,"A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.",No
21849,So I want to keep the quality of health care.,No
21850,That means keep government out of it.,No
21851,I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.,No
21853,"I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point.",No
21854,I think medical care should go with the person.,No

25270,This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.,No
25271,Now we have a runaway arms race.,No
25284,I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.,No
25291,"I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States.",No
25292,"We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process.",No
25296,And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.,No
25297,The second part is to maintain and improve relations with our friends to the south.,No
25298,We cannot solve this problem all on our own.,No
25299,"And that's why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good-faith way with Mexico, with Costa Rica, with the other nations in trying to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in Central America has undermined our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well.",Yes
25304,"I think you're right that the polls show that the majority of Hispanics want that bill, so I'm not doing it for political reasons.",Yes
25309,"I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation.",No
25315,"Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate.",Yes
25316,"However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill.",No
25319,I can't go into detail about them here.,No
25320,But it is true our borders are out of control.,No
25322,And I supported this bill.,Yes
25323,I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.,No
25325,We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.,No
25326,"And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders.",No
25340,"And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs.",Yes
25344,"And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people.",No
25349,"Well, my rebuttal is I've heard the national debt blamed for a lot of things, but not for illegal immigration across our border -- [laughter] -- and it has nothing to do with it.",No
25350,"But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate.",Yes
25352,"So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did.",No
25363,"But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow.",No
25365,"Now, with regard to having to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war, of course we would.",No
25369,"And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?",No
25376,But suppose we came up with that?,No
25377,"Now, some people have said, ""Ah, that would make war imminent, because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy.''",No
25378,But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?,No
25380,We'll even give it to you.,No
25381,"Now, will you sit down with us and once and for all get rid, all of us, of these nuclear weapons and free mankind from that threat?''",No
25382,I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.,No
25390,"Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?",No
25391,There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.,No
25392,"If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea.",No
25395,The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.,No
25399,And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.,No
25400,We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.,No
25401,"If we could stop, right now, the testing and the deployment of these space weapons -- and the President's proposals go clear beyond research; if it was just research we wouldn't have any argument, because maybe someday, somebody will think of something -- but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapons at this time, in their crude state, would bring about an arms race that's very dangerous indeed.",No
25406,"It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go.",No
25414,I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.,No
25415,I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.,No
25416,That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.,No
25417,"Now, why do I support the freeze?",No
25418,Because this ever-rising arms race madness makes both nations less secure.,No
25419,It's more difficult to defend this nation.,No
25420,It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.,No
25422,"We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --",No
25424,-- -- and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.,No
25426,"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?",No
25428,"Now, if you're willing to join us in getting rid of all the nuclear weapons in the world, then we'll give you this one, so that we would both know that no one can cheat; that we're both got something that if anyone tries to cheat .",No
25435,"I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off.",No
25438,"If they're space weapons, I assume they'll be in space.",No
25442,"And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with.",No
25443,"You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President.",No
25444,"You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose.",Yes
25446,"And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do.",No
25447,"If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else.",No
25448,But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.,No
25449,Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure?,No
25450,That's what a President's for.,No
25459,Why I disagree with the MX is that it's a sitting duck.,No
25461,"It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon.",No
25462,"And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1.",Yes
25466,"In other words, a President has to make choices.",No
25468,The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.,No
25470,"We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons.",No
25471,"It's in this way, by making wise choices, that we're stronger, we enhance the chances of arms control.",No
25472,"Every President until this one has been able to do it, and this nation -- or the world is more dangerous as a result.",No
25480,"I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable.",No
25487,"I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day.",No
25488,"In other words, we've got to be tough.",No
25489,"But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement.",No
25497,And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.,No
25504,"And the promise of the revolution was democracy, human rights, free labor unions, free press.",Yes
25508,And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.,Yes
25509,"And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?",Yes
25510,It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.,No
25512,"And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative.",No
25515,"Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow.",No
25516,"And there is every evidence, every indication that that government would be hostile to the United States.",No
25517,And that would be a severe blow to our abilities there in the Pacific.,No
25522,Perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration's policies on human rights.,No
25523,"I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases.",Yes
25526,"What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa.",Yes
25528,We need to stand for human rights.,No
25529,We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.,No
25530,National security and human rights must go together.,No
25531,But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.,No
25535,I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed.,No
25536,"I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world.",No
25537,Mr. Mondale has recently announced a plan of his to get the democracies together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy.,Yes
25552,"I am not going to roll over, as Mr. Mondale suggests, and give them something that could turn around and be used against us.",No
25554,"But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours.",Yes
25555,"I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights.",No
25557,"Mr. Mondale, could I ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then?",No
25559,"Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?",No
25560,I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.,No
25562,"And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us.",No
25563,"Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality.",No
25564,The President says he wants to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapons.,Yes
25565,"But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history.",Yes
25567,"Well, maybe someday, somebody can dream of that.",No
25568,But why start an arms race now?,No
25570,Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?,No
25572,"A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on.",No
25573,I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.,No
25574,But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.,No
25576,"And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale.",No
25585,"I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong.",No
25586,But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.,No
25587,That's key to the strength of our nation.,No
25588,A President must know the essential facts essential to command.,No
25589,But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go.,No
25591,And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.,No
25592,"As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth.",No
25596,America is not temporary; we're forever.,No
25597,"And as Americans, our generation should protect this wonderful land for our children.",No
25598,"I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble.",No
25599,"And, above all, I want a nation that's strong.",No
25600,"Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens.",Yes
25602,This weakens the chances of civilization to survive.,No
25605,"That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers.",No
25606,A President must know right then.,No
25609,America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.,No
25611,"When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world.",No
25612,We need to move on.,No
25614,"Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation.",No
25617,"My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting.",No
25621,"Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong?",No
25622,"We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present.",No
25623,The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.,No
25625,It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.,No
25626,I remember driving down the California coast one day.,No
25629,"And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing.",No
25630,"And with that thought, I realized what a job I had with that letter.",No
25631,I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.,No
25634,"They would know how we solved them, and whether our solution was beneficial to them down through the years or whether it hurt them.",No
25635,"They would also know that we lived in a world with terrible weapons, nuclear weapons of terrible destructive power, aimed at each other, capable of crossing the ocean in a matter of minutes and destroying civilization as we knew it.",No
25638,"Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny.",No
25639,"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''",No
25642,We have met young America.,No
25647,I was just going to -- --,No

25685,"In 20 days, you will help decide who will lead this country into the next century.",No
25687,"And you must ask yourself, do you know enough about the candidates?",No
25698,"But in any event, I understand the problems.",No
25709,"I have a simple philosophy that I tried to follow for the last four years: Do what creates opportunity for all, what reinforces responsibility from all of us, and what will help us build a community where everybody's got a role to play and a place at the table.",No
25711,"We've got ten and a half million more jobs, the deficit's been reduced by 60 percent.",Yes
25714,But that progress is only the beginning.,No
25746,There's no doubt about it that many American people have lost their faith in government.,No
25751,So there's a great deal of cynicism out there.,No
25755,"I think we have a real obligation, obviously public officials.",No
25780,"Well, bringing people together, again, is obviously a responsibility we all have.",No
25783,You do a lot of things nobody knows about.,No
25784,I have a little foundation for the disabled called the Dole Foundation.,No
25786,We don't talk about it.,No
25790,"When you're the president of the United States, you have a public trust and you have to keep that public trust, as George Washington, as Abraham Lincoln did.",No
25807,"In the next four years, I want to focus on the following things.",No
25810,"Number three, cover people who are between jobs for up to six months.",No
25817,We've always had at least 7 percent.,Yes
25828,"But if somebody wanted to be a cardiologist, ten years from now, you'd have to be certain you complied with some of the rules in this extreme medical plan the government was going to take over for all Americans.",No
25833,But let me just say the American Hospital Association said that the budget I vetoed could have closed 700 hospitals.,Yes
25841,These things are paid for in the balanced budget plan.,Yes
25850,It shouldn't happen in America.,No
25861,Thank you for doing what you're doing.,No

25878,We had 25 fighter wings.,Yes
25882,"I mean, we've cut defense spending too much in the first place.",Yes
25885,But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.,No
25914,I think we need to go back and take a look.,No
25918,The last thing we want to do is commit more forces anywhere.,No
25965,We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.,Yes
25968,"Then we took comments, as we always do, and there were tens of thousands of comments as to how we ought to do it.",No
25969,That's what drug it out.,No

26008,And we will do that.,No
26013,That's more than it's had a lot of the time in the last years.,Yes
26015,Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.,No
26017,"Well again, if you're somebody thinking about the future, I think it's fair to say that it'll be -- we'll work it out.",No

26024,"We suggested -- I think it has been over a year ago now -- we do the same with Medicare, and the White House called it a gimmick.",Yes
26025,Now last week I guess it was Donna Shalala said well we'll cut Medicare a hundred billion and appoint a commission.,Yes
26026,It will probably have to be done by a commission.,No

26066,It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.,No
26071,It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.,Yes
26073,I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.,Yes

26119,We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.,Yes
26128,So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.,Yes

26172,"He'll claim credit now for crime going down, but it happens because mayors and governors and others have brought crime down.",Yes

30039,"He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.",No
30040,"The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.",No

30069,She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,Yes
30071,And then you wouldn't have had them.,No
30073,"And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",No
30075,"Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.",No

30086,That's the most important part of this.,No

30118,"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.",Yes

30120,"And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.",Yes
30121,And I was very strong.,No

30235,"... have a good time, folks.",No
30237,"And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.",No
30239,And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,No

31931,I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.,Yes
31932,And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,Yes
31933,"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.",No
31935,But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.,No
31937,We have seen him insult women.,Yes
31940,"We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.",Yes
31941,"So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.",No
31942,"But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.",Yes
31944,"And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.",No
31945,"That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.",No
31946,"These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.",No
31947,And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.,No
31949,Am I allowed to respond to that?,No
31955,"I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.",Yes
31958,"I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.",No
31977,That was locker room talk.,No
31978,I'm not proud of it.,No
31979,"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.",No
31981,But that was something that happened.,No
31982,"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.",No
31987,Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.,Yes
31989,"One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.",No
31990,"Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.",Yes
31991,"Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.",No
31993,I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.,No
31996,"He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.",Yes
32002,"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.",No
32003,He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.,No
32004,"Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.",No
32006,"(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.",No
32009,And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,Yes
32013,"He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.",No
32015,So you really owe him an apology.,No
32021,"So, you talk about friend?",No
32023,"And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.",No
32024,And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.,No
32025,"But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.",Yes
32028,"But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.",No
32029,"There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.",No
32030,"When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.",No
32031,"In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.",No
32032,"There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.",Yes
32033,"So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?",No
32036,"And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.",No
32040,"... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.",Yes
32045,I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.,No
32047,"So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.",No
32050,Because you'd be in jail.,No
32061,"Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.",No
32078,I'm watching Hillary go over facts.,No
32080,"You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?",No
32082,"She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.",Yes
32084,"33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.",Yes
32085,"And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.",Yes
32088,She got it from the United States Congress.,Yes
32092,What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.,Yes
32102,"Look, it's just not true.",No
32104,"Oh, you didn't delete them?",No
32109,"Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...",Yes
32111,"What about the other 15,000?",No
32114,"Yes, that's true, I didn't.",No
32115,Because you have nothing to say.,No
32120,But let's at least focus...,No
32124,... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.,No
32125,Let's get to their questions.,No
32129,"I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?",No
32137,It's nice to -- one on three.,No
32147,"If he wants to start, he can start.",No
32149,"No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.",No
32153,"Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.",No
32154,"And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.",No
32157,"But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.",Yes
32160,"But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.",Yes
32161,"Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.",Yes
32164,"Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.",Yes
32165,So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,No
32166,But we've got to get costs down.,No
32167,We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.,No
32169,And then we would have to start all over again.,No
32170,"Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.",Yes
32171,That's the highest we've ever been in our country.,Yes
32173,"So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.",No
32175,"It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.",No
32179,It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.,Yes
32182,"In '17, it implodes by itself.",Yes
32183,"Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.",No
32184,We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.,Yes
32186,"It's very bad, very bad health insurance.",No
32188,"And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.",No
32189,It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,No
32190,"We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.",No
32191,"We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.",Yes
32193,You will have the finest health care plan there is.,No
32196,It's catastrophic in certain ways.,No
32199,Obamacare was the first step.,No
32201,"And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.",Yes
32203,"It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.",No
32209,"Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.",No
32213,"Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.",No
32215,"And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.",Yes
32218,"... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...",No
32234,We're going to be able to.,No
32237,"Well, I'll tell you what it means.",No
32239,Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...,No
32241,"President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.",No
32243,"You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.",Yes
32246,"But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.",No
32247,"And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.",No
32248,We're going to block grant into the states.,No
32249,We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...,No
32251,... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.,No
32259,But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.,No
32261,And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.,No
32262,"When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.",No
32263,"As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.",Yes
32265,They'll never be the same.,No
32266,Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.,No
32267,"And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.",No
32268,"If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.",No
32275,She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.,No
32276,But the name is there.,No
32278,"And before you solve it, you have to say the name.",No
32282,"And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.",Yes
32283,I want to say just a couple of things.,No
32286,We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.,No
32287,"My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.",No
32289,That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,No
32292,I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.,No
32294,"It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.",No
32295,"Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?",No
32298,And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.,No
32299,So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.,No
32306,"First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.",Yes
32308,So he would have been alive today.,No
32317,Why don't you interrupt her?,No
32320,We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,Yes
32321,And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.,Yes
32322,"People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.",Yes
32323,This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.,No
32324,We have enough problems in this country.,No
32325,I believe in building safe zones.,No
32326,"I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.",No
32333,"Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.",No
32334,"But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.",No
32338,"But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.",No
32342,How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?,No
32344,And how do we expect to be able to implement those?,No
32345,So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.,No
32347,"And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.",Yes
32350,"It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.",Yes
32353,That has not been debunked.,Yes
32355,I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.,Yes
32363,She just went about 25 seconds over her time.,No
32365,"Could I just respond to this, please?",No
32368,"When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.",Yes
32369,"In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.",Yes
32371,"And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.",Yes
32372,"Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.",No
32375,We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.,Yes
32380,"The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.",Yes
32386,"She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.",No
32398,"It was principled, and it was strategic.",No
32400,"And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.",No
32401,That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.,No
32402,"But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.",Yes
32404,"We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.",Yes
32405,"And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.",No
32407,"Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.",Yes
32409,And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...,No
32412,... with the Russians and other foreign powers.,No
32414,"Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.",No
32415,"Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.",No
32416,"Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.",Yes
32423,That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.,No
32424,"That's a big, big difference.",No
32430,Maybe there is no hacking.,No
32432,And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.,No
32434,"I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.",No
32436,I have no businesses there.,Yes
32439,"One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.",No
32440,But I have no loans with Russia.,Yes
32441,"You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.",No
32446,"Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.",Yes
32448,I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.,Yes
32449,"But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.",No
32460,"One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.",No
32461,"And she could have done this years ago, by the way.",No
32464,"Well, why didn't she change it?",No
32465,Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?,No
32466,The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.,No
32469,"But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.",Yes
32470,But -- and I say that about a lot of things.,No
32472,I wish you would have done this.,No
32475,And she never will change.,No
32477,We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.,Yes
32488,That in itself is a big difference.,No
32489,We are going to be thriving again.,No
32490,We have no growth in this country.,Yes
32492,"If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.",No
32494,"And that's, like, no growth.",No
32497,And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.,No
32498,And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.,No
32499,But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.,Yes
32503,"I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.",No
32505,But I'll tell you what he's going to do.,No
32507,"Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.",No
32509,"Now, here's what I want to do.",No
32510,"I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.",Yes
32511,And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.,No
32512,"And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.",Yes
32513,"I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.",Yes
32514,I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.,No
32517,I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.,No
32519,I want to invest in hard-working families.,No
32520,"And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.",Yes
32522,"People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.",Yes
32536,"And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.",Yes
32541,"And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.",No
32543,"See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.",No
32544,"Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.",Yes
32545,"But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.",No
32546,Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.,No
32547,"But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.",Yes
32549,And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.,Yes
32551,So we won't make them famous.,No
32554,"But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.",No
32558,I say it all the time.,No
32559,She talks about health care.,No
32562,Why didn't she do something about it?,No
32563,She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.,No
32564,"With her, it's all talk and no action.",No
32566,"And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.",No
32567,She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.,No
32568,"She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.",No
32570,"They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.",Yes
32574,"Well, here we go again.",No
32576,But that's not the point here.,No
32577,Why didn't you do it?,No
32580,Because I was a senator with a Republican president.,No
32582,I will be the president and we will get it done.,No
32584,"You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",No
32585,"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",No
32590,"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that.""",No
32591,So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.,No
32592,I'm very glad to do so.,No
32593,"Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.",Yes
32596,"Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.",Yes
32597,"When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.",Yes
32598,Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.,Yes
32607,"I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...",No
32622,"And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.",Yes
32626,"So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.",Yes
32627,"We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.",No
32628,And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.,No
32632,I've stood up to Russia.,No
32636,That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.,Yes
32638,So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.,No
32642,"First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...",No
32645,"I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...",No
32647,But you were in contact -- excuse me.,No
32649,"At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.",No
32652,Obama draws the line in the sand.,No
32653,It was laughed at all over the world what happened.,No
32654,"Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.",No
32655,"But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.",No
32657,Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.,No
32664,She talks in favor of the rebels.,Yes
32668,They end up being worse than the people.,No
32669,Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.,No
32673,I'm sure you probably have heard that.,No
32677,We sign a peace treaty.,No
32679,"Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.",Yes

32723,"The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.",No
32724,They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.,Yes
32725,"So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.",Yes
32726,"Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.",Yes
32727,Why can't they do it quietly?,No
32728,"Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?",No
32730,"Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?",No
32731,How stupid is our country?,No
32736,And I'm pretty good at it.,No
32741,We talk about it all the time.,No
32742,"They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?",No

32763,I don't think that is a smart strategy.,No
32764,"I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...",Yes
32766,"Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...",No
32769,I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,No
32770,"And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.",Yes
32774,I would go after Baghdadi.,No
32776,So I think that could help.,No
32777,I would also consider arming the Kurds.,No
32779,"And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.",No
32783,"She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.",No
32784,"When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.",No

32826,It's just going to be talk.,No
32827,"And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.",No
32828,She's not doing any me favors.,No
32829,"But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.",No
32833,All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.,No
32839,"Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.",Yes

32882,... but we believed that we could make the country better.,No
32885,We have a divided nation.,No
32891,"We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.",No
32906,She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?,No
32910,"... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.",No
32911,"Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.",No
32918,"Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.",No
32919,"I mean, you can like it or not like it.",No

32926,I'm shocked to hear that.,No
32928,"Well, it's not only my opinion.",No
32930,"But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.",Yes
32936,He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,Yes
32937,That was a terrible time for our country.,No
32939,Nine million people lost their jobs.,Yes

32944,We are back on the right track.,No
32962,This is one of the most important issues in this election.,No
32963,"I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.",No
32964,Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.,No
32965,"And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.",No
32968,"I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.",No
32969,"Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.",No
32971,I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.,No
32974,So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.,No

32983,And we have a vacancy.,No
32984,I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.,No
32985,"I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.",No
32987,And I think that this is so important.,No
32988,"Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.",No
32989,"They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.",No
32993,What I ask is this.,No
32998,She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.,Yes
33001,Why aren't you putting some money in?,No
33002,You have a lot of it.,No
33012,"And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.",No
33013,"But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.",No
33016,We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.,No
33029,And you look at our miners.,No
33032,"Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.",Yes

33037,I will bring our energy companies back.,No
33038,They'll be able to compete.,No
33040,They'll pay off our national debt.,No
33042,But we are putting our energy companies out of business.,Yes
33044,"You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.",Yes
33045,We have to guard our energy companies.,No
33046,We have to make it possible.,No
33048,"And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.",No
33054,"And actually -- well, that was very interesting.",No
33055,"First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.",Yes
33056,That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.,Yes
33063,And I think that's an important transition.,No
33064,We've got to remain energy-independent.,No
33065,It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.,No
33068,"And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.",No
33071,A lot of them lost their lives.,No
33073,I don't want to walk away from them.,No
33076,But the price of coal is down worldwide.,Yes
33077,So we have to look at this comprehensively.,No
33079,And that's exactly what I have proposed.,Yes
33080,I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.,No
33093,"I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.",No
33094,And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.,No
33095,"So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.",No
33096,"This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.",No
33097,"We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.",No
33098,It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.,No
33099,"And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.",No
33101,And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.,No
33105,"And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.",No
33106,So I consider that a compliment.,No
33107,I will say this about Hillary.,No
33111,I tell it like it is.,No
33113,I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.,No
33114,I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.,No
33115,"But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.",No
33116,And I consider that to be a very good trait.,No
33144,And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.,No
33145,"You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?",No
33147,What kind of rights will Americans have?,No
33148,"And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.",No
33150,I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.,No
33151,"But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.",No
33152,"That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.",No
33155,That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.,No
33161,"Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.",No
33162,The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.,No
33163,"Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.",No
33167,"But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.",No
33168,"We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.",No
33169,"I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.",No
33173,They will be protecting the Second Amendment.,No
33175,They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.,No
33176,"And I believe that's very, very important.",No
33178,"It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.",No
33189,I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.,No
33195,"And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.",Yes
33196,"I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.",No
33199,"And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.",Yes
33201,So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.,No
33216,"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.",Yes
33217,"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.",No
33219,"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.",Yes
33220,The gun lobby's on his side.,Yes
33222,"And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.",No
33223,"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.",Yes
33227,"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.",No
33228,"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.",Yes
33229,"So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.",Yes
33231,"And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.",No
33232,And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.,Yes
33234,We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.,No
33235,"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.",No
33243,"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.",No
33246,"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.",No
33247,"And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.",No
33251,"And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.",No
33252,It is about what's happening right now in America.,No
33254,Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.,Yes
33256,I will defend Planned Parenthood.,No
33257,"I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.",No
33266,"And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.",No
33267,"The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.",No
33269,I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.,No
33270,So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.,No
33274,"If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.",Yes
33275,"Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.",No
33279,And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.,No
33282,And I do not believe the government should be making it.,No
33283,"You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.",No
33285,"And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.",No
33286,And I will stand up for that right.,No
33289,"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.",No
33308,We have no country if we have no border.,No
33309,Hillary wants to give amnesty.,Yes
33310,She wants to have open borders.,Yes
33311,"The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.",Yes
33313,It means their job is tougher.,No
33315,They know it better than anybody.,No
33317,They feel we have to have strong borders.,No
33327,We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,No
33330,"And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.",Yes
33332,We shore up the border.,No
33333,"One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.",No
33334,We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,No
33335,"And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.",No
33341,"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.",No
33343,I don't want to rip families apart.,No
33346,We have 11 million undocumented people.,Yes
33347,"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.",Yes
33350,"It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.",No
33351,"And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.",No
33354,I have been for border security for years.,Yes
33355,I voted for border security in the United States Senate.,Yes
33361,He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.,Yes
33368,I think I should respond to that.,No
33369,"First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.",No
33371,We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.,No
33373,"The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.",Yes
33375,Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,Yes
33376,Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.,Yes
33377,"Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.",No
33380,We are a country of laws.,No
33381,We either have -- and by the way...,No
33386,"I voted for border security, and there are...",Yes
33390,"But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.",Yes
33391,"Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.",No
33393,He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.,Yes
33397,President Obama has moved millions of people out.,Yes
33404,We either have a border or we don't.,No
33407,We have millions of people that did it the right way.,No
33410,"We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.",No
33415,But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.,Yes
33417,We will not have open borders.,No
33427,"... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.",Yes
33445,Those are the questions we need answered.,No
33446,We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.,Yes
33458,People are going to come in from Syria.,No
33459,"She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.",Yes
33466,He said nice things about me.,No
33467,"If we got along well, that would be good.",No
33468,"If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.",No
33469,He has no respect for her.,No
33471,"And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.",Yes
33476,"Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.",No
33481,It's pretty clear you won't admit...,No
33483,"... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.",Yes
33484,So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.,No
33486,"We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.",Yes
33487,I find that deeply disturbing.,No
33489,And I think it's time you take a stand...,No
33490,"She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.",No
33494,"Hillary, you have no idea.",No
33495,... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...,No
33496,And our country has no idea.,No
33500,"Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.",No
33501,I find that just absolutely...,No
33503,She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.,No
33506,Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.,No
33515,By Russia or anybody else.,No
33523,"But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.",No
33524,"Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.",No
33525,"Whether it's Syria, you name it.",No
33527,"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed.",No
33529,"They create warheads, and we can't.",Yes
33530,The Russians can't believe it.,No
33531,She has been outsmarted by Putin.,No
33532,And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.,No
33535,They've taken over the Middle East.,No
33536,She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.,No

33602,That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.,Yes

33936,So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.,Yes

33940,Why don't you give back the money?,No
33941,I think it would be a great gesture.,No

33949,I'm very proud of that.,No
33950,We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.,Yes
33951,"And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.",Yes
33954,"But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.",Yes
33957,The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.,Yes
33959,And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...,No

33991,"You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.",Yes
33993,I find that just astonishing.,No
34000,Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.,No
34002,You know what she should have done?,No
34008,You should have changed the law.,No
34009,"But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.",No
34010,"I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...",No
34016,"And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.",No
34018,"If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.",No
34024,I will look at it at the time.,No
34026,I'll look at it at the time.,No
34027,What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.,No
34033,I think they're going to see through it.,No
34034,We'll find out on November 8th.,No
34035,But I think they're going to see through it.,No
34037,"If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.",Yes

34041,She shouldn't be allowed to run.,No
34044,"And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...",No
34050,What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.,No
34051,I'll keep you in suspense.,No

34056,They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.,Yes
34058,He lost the Wisconsin primary.,Yes
34060,Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.,Yes
34064,This is -- this is a mindset.,No
34068,So that is not the way our democracy works.,No
34070,We've had free and fair elections.,No
34071,We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.,No
34072,And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.,No

34080,He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.,No

34083,I think it's a disgrace.,No
34085,I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.,No
34096,"Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.",Yes
34097,But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.,No
34098,"I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.",No
34099,"In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.",No
34101,It's going to be a hard fight.,No
34102,I've got no illusions about that.,No
34103,"And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.",No
34104,I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.,No
34105,But we know we've got lots of work to do.,No
34107,"So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.",No
34108,"That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.",No
34110,"And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.",No
34113,"Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.",No
34116,Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.,Yes

34122,These people have all left.,Yes
34132,That's why we have the great migration.,No
34133,But she wanted to look good for the election.,No
34140,Going to be more deaths that they thought.,No
34141,But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.,No
34143,So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.,No
34145,"Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.",Yes
34146,So we're now going to take Mosul.,No
34147,And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?,No
34150,But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.,Yes
34151,"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.",Yes
34152,"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.",No
34156,I said it was a mistake.,Yes
34157,I've said that years ago.,No
34165,And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.,Yes
34168,"Now, why does that matter?",No
34170,I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.,Yes
34171,But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.,No
34172,Mosul is a Sunni city.,No
34176,"But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.",No
34177,There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.,Yes
34179,They've been prepared to defend.,No
34180,It's going to be tough fighting.,No
34181,"But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.",No
34185,"Chris, we don't gain anything.",No
34188,Iran is taking over Iraq.,Yes
34199,We could have gained if they did it by surprise.,No
34202,"No, you are the one that's unfit.",No
34208,"If you think that was good, then you do.",No
34212,"Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.",No
34229,Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?,No
34232,Take a look at it.,No
34244,"I mean, what do you need, a signed document?",No
34246,It is so sad when you see what's happened.,No
34249,He -- he aligned with Russia.,No
34250,"He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.",Yes
34255,We gave them $1.7 billion.,Yes

34259,"We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.",Yes
34260,We don't know who the rebels are.,No
34262,"But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.",No
34263,"If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.",No
34267,And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.,No
34269,Thanks a lot for doing a great job.,No
34275,"Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.",No
34277,This would not be done just on the first day.,No
34280,We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.,Yes
34281,"So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.",No
34282,But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.,No
34284,"I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.",No
34285,But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.,No
34287,"And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.",No
34288,"That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.",No
34290,So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.,No
34293,But I just have to...,No
34295,It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.,No
34296,We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.,No
34297,"And right now, they're in 32 countries.",Yes
34299,We should have -- wait one second.,No
34302,"And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.",Yes
34306,I assume she had nothing to do with it.,No
